Merits & Flaws: BELOW FROM SIMILAR VENTRUE
	Bad Sight (1 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 297)
		Can wear glasses for it, or it would be more points
	Natural Leader (1 pt. Merit, Core pg. 300)
		2 extra dice for Leadership roles
	Enchanting Voice (2 pt. Merit, Core pg. 296)
		-2 difficulty for "all die rolls involving the use of the voice to persuade, charm or command"
		As written, sounds like it should affect disciplines
			Though that certainly makes it powerful. As such many internet posts argued against it.
