Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-Embraced in your late 30's, you have salt and pepper hair.
		-Well under 5 ft. tall.
		-You have a strange presence that makes most mortals uncomfortable.
			-It began after your embrace and grew with your arcane studies.
			-Your height probably doesn't help the impression much.
	-As a mortal:
		-
		-You swear your aversion to garlic preexisted your embrace, and are tired of the jokes about it.
			-You'd really prefer that others simply didn't find out.
	-Sire embraced you to help in some grand ritual, his (un)life's work.
		-You will be pissed if you ever learn that your height was a factor.
			-"You had to fit in the ritual apparatus!"
				-The Path of Conjuration's limit of object size to the size of the caster is probably a factor here.
		-As such, your training in Thaumaturgy was narrow and relentless.
			-His focus was on making you into a high level ritual practitioner as soon as possible.
				-Your stats reflect both that training and what he selected you for.
			-You quickly resented this, a feeling that grew dramatically as your reading and limited interaction
			 with the rest of Clan Tremere suggested it wasn't typically like this.
				-Other apprentices, even at the same chantry, clearly saw vastly more of (un)life outside it.
				-You were also fascinated by the various Paths, but your sire refused you instruction in any but
				 that of blood.
					-He went so far as to interfere with any instruction from fellow apprentices too.
					-"You only need master the blood for our great work!"
						-You really hated that "our".
		-He was regent of the isolated chantry where you were trained.
			-It was actually a rather low position for one so old and well versed in Thaumaturgy.
			-He somehow prevented you from being transfered, staying at one chantry far longer than the clan would
			 usually allow.
			-That, and the freedom and resources he had to pursue his ritual, suggested some kind of pull higher in
			 the pyramid.
			-That changed abruptly one night.
				-You awoke and your sire was already gone, replaced by a stranger who introduced herself as the new
				 regent.
				-Your sire's ritual laboratory and notes were packed away and shipped to an unknown location.
		-The new regent interviewed and tested you extensively.
			-What she found clearly impressed her.
				-Though you're training had been narrow, you were indeed a powerful thaumaturge.
			-As such, when she arranged the transfer you were long overdue for, there were many regents eager to
			 claim some credit for the talent your sire had hidden away.
			-You had, in your interviews with your sire's replacement, mentioned an interest in The Path of the
			 Focused Mind.
				-Perhaps that's why you found yourself in the chantry you were recently relocated to, as it's
				 regent is a master of the path.
				-Or, perhaps, the clan sees in the path an opportunity to further hone the ritual practitioner it
				 has been handed.
	-Your rescue from your sire at the hands of Clan Tremere's standard practices have engendered in you a lot of
	 affection for, and faith in, The Pyramid.
		-Accurate or not (probably at least a little bit), you view your sire's treatment of you as pretty typical
		 of the average vampire.
			-You believe Clan Tremere to be different, as it's normal rules should have prevented your sire's
			 monopolization of an apprentice and The Pyramid at least claims to be for the good of all it's members.
		-It's politics are also a somewhat comfortable return to the politics of your beloved academia, at least
		 compared to your sire's dictatorial mandates.
	-You seek training in additional paths, particularly The Focused Mind.
		-First, though, you likely need to prove yourself to your new regent.
		-In other words, you've a ready made plot hook for anything your regent would support.
	-What rank are you in The Pyramid?
		-Probably lower than you should be.
		-Do ranks correspond to the status background or anything like that?
	-Do you know any rituals other than the one that a single dot of Thaumaturgy grants you?
		-Probably not, unless the Storyteller is feeling generous.
		-If not, it's a bit odd, given your knowledge and Thaumaturgy rating.
			-Still, it can be worked into your background. Your sire didn't much care about your ability to do any
			 ritual but his grand one.
		-You'd certainly like to learn more.

	-Oh god. A Tremere can do terrible things with rituals and melee weapons.
	 Like, flaming sword that drinks blood for you and acts as a talisman,
	 making most of your Thaumaturgy easier, terrible.
		-Taking melee instead of firearms would aid this.
			-Maybe you fence? Your height would at least come with some
			 advantages there, rather than _just_ disadvantages.
