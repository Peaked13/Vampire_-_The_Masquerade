Merits & Flaws: (+1 Freebie Points)
	Short (1 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 481):
		-Half running speed and difficulty using things meant for normal adult size.
	Tic/Twitch (1 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 481):
		-Hand wringing?
		-I like that it presages the fugue state.
	Disfigured (2 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 481):
		-Appearance is max 2 and all social rolls have +2 difficulty.
		-Tied to your short height, some development issues or malformation?
			-Or a rude awakening acquired shortly after running away from home?
	Concentration (1 pt. Merit, Core pg. 484):
		-Unaffected by penalties stemming from distracting circumstances.
	Eidetic Memory (2 pt. Merit, Core pg. )?
		-You remember things with perfect detail, including documents, photos, conversations, etc.
		-Under "stressful conditions involving numerous distractions", roll Perception + Alertness
		 (difficulty 6) to do so.
			-Unless Concentration means you never have to?!?
	Phobia (2 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 486):
		-Courage roll or retreat everytime you encounter your phobia.
		-Snakes? Best of the suggested ones for this, but search other examples online.
	Medium (2 pt. Merit, Core pg. 493)?
		Or Oracular Ability from the same page? Or drop it entirely for more Willpower?
			That last is probably best, especially with your derangement and Auspex 5. . .
