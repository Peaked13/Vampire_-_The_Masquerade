Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-A slight latina girl in life, your appearance now readily betrays your flirtation with The
		 Abyss. Your skin has darkened to nearly the same jet black as your hair (Blood of Ahriman
		 ritual). Your touch is colder than even a Kindred has right to be and mortals tremble in
		 your presence (your flaws).
	-As a mortal:
		-Probably not the greatest childhood.
		-You were a mean girl.
			-You delighted in belittling and tormenting others.
				-You were about as hard on yourself.
			-Really, you feared abandonment and that others would inevitably let you down. If they
			 (and you) saw them as pathetic, maybe they wouldn't go. Inevitably, this ensured that
			 they did.
			-Nonetheless, you always managed to drag new "friends" into your circle, for a time, at
			 least.
		-You spoke Spanish at home, but mostly English otherwise.
	-Your embrace:
		-At age 19, you were part of a Sabbat mass embrace.
		-The last memory you have of your mortal life is darkness.
			-Your sire surrounded you in a Shroud of Night, drained you, and dragged you off to
			 perform the embrace.
			-In that darkness, you first felt peace, even if it was the peace that causes a rabbit
			 to go limp in a wolf's jaws.
	-After the embrace, you and twelve others were turned loose as part of a Sabbat siege.
		-By the time other vampires of the Sabbat came to collect the survivors, just before
		 dawn, you were the only one that remained, hiding in an alley and shrouded in wisps of
		 darkness.
			-Several died protecting you, while the last died distracting a Camarilla vampire
			 that was pursuing you. You told him the way you'd come was clear, then ran the
			 opposite direction.
	-You sire met his final death in the siege, but you were adopted into his pack, all Lasombra.
		-One member, in particular, took a liking to you.
			-He was older than the rest of the pack, and a master of Obtenebration.
			-He was a also a relative newcomer to the pack.
			-He'd witnessed a bit of your manipulation of the others you were embraced with, and
			 was the one who found you in the alley, swathed in shadows.
		-As they tutored you in Obtenebration, the darkness you loved even before your first
		 drop of blood, the abyssal secrets he could share quickly made him your favorite too.
		-From him, you not only grew powerful in Obtenebration, you also learned the secrets
		 and rituals of Abyss Mysticism as well. Soon, you too were following his footsteps on
		 The Path of Night.
		-The pack as a whole, though, slowly grew more dysfunctional during your time with them.
			-More cruel, too.
			-Eventually, as the tenants of the Path of Night were revealed to you, you recognized
			 your tutor's hand in this.
			-He would set them against each other, formenting needless conflicts.
			-When you confronted him about it, he used it as an excuse to lecture about the path,
			 saying his evil influence would only strengthen the best of the pack, breaking only
			 what was weak.
				-"Ahriman consumes, but the weak fall first into his maw."
		-Then, when you awoke one evening, your tutor was gone. None of the other pack members
		 could (or would) tell you where he had gone.
		-You strongly suspect they killed him or drove him off.
		-As far as you're concerned, that suspicion was confirmed when, a short while after he
		 disappeard, they moved to get rid of you.
			-They left you with a newly formed pack of similarly young Sabbat.
			-They said the pack was moving to take part in a dangerous crusade, and that there
			 you'd find a mission more suited to your talents.
			-You believe they wanted to get rid of the last of your tutor's influence.
	-You love The Abyss.
		-What fault can you possibly find in *nothing*? And, you know it wants you, with a. . .
		 hunger that no one else ever has. You felt it that very first night of your new life.

Equipment (stuff to start with or obtain):
	

Advancement:
	-Disciplines:
		-Fortitude would be the most important discipline to acquire.
			-Beyond protecting you, your Arms even benefit from it.
			-Sweet combo too: Armor of Darkness (Dark Ages Companion, page 87, column 2), Obtenebration 4, Fortitude 2
		-Celerity would be pretty good too.
		-Dominate also has potential.
			-It's a clan discipline and the checks requires are well suited to your attributes and
			 abilities.
		-Obfuscate has some mild potential too.
		-Potence, your other clan discipline, isn't very good for you, since it doesn't read like
		 it applies to the tentacles (*maybe* to attack with attached to you lvl 4 tentacles).
			-It allows an *amazing* combo, Dark Steel, though, for Obtenebration 3 and Potence 3.
				-Libellus Sanguinus 1, page 33
			-Armory of the Abyss lets you make weapons from shadows with the same requirements, and
			 armor too, with Fortitude 3.
		-Koldunic Sorcery would also be an option
			-The Ways of Fire and Sorrow both benefit from your high manipulation
				-The former isn't too thematic, given your love of _darkness_, but the latter very much is
			-The easy rituals that recover willpower are so good that, if power gaming, essentially 
			 _everyone_ should take a dot
			-If you're going to use one of the Ways (maybe not, if you just want the level 1 rituals),
			 you'll want The Way of the Spirit too.
			-It unfortunately uses it's own Knowledge, Koldunism, rather than Occult
		-Otherwise, as generation permits it, advancing Obtenebration is probably the most beneficial
		 thing you can do.
	-You're extremely interested in any Abyss Mysticism rituals you can possibly learn about.
		-Both for roleplay and power reasons.
	-Until then, and until you can learn new disciplines, Brawl and Dodge are decent abilities to increase.
	-In an especially stable and immobile pack, you might consider the Herd background, to solve
	 that high blood expenditure.
	-Your real advancement likely only comes with diablerie.
		-You burn blood like crazy, and need the expanded pool.
		-That's the only way you'll ever further increase your Obtenebration too.
	-Tentative schedule:
