	Vengeful (2 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 299):
		-You are obsessed with taking your revenge on an individual or group, and it is your
		 overridding priority in any situation where you encounter the object of your revenge.
		-You may temporarily resist your need for vengeance by spending a Willpower point.
		-You're obsessed with revenge on the Camarilla Ventrue, having wholeheartedly embraced your
		 antitribu brethren's scorn for them, in no small part due to their prominence feeling like 
		 that of your hated older brother, from your mortal life.
	Grip of the Damned (4 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 302):
		-There is no ecstasy in your Embrace - only terror and pain. Mortals upon whom you feed
		 struggle and shriek all the while as you attempt to feed, requiring you to grapple with
		 them for as long as you wish to take their blood.

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-As a mortal:
		-Second son of a priviliged family, overshadowed and resentful.
			-Family now dead at your hands?
		-Runner?
			-Self-soothing through exhaustion tied to it?
		-
	-Your embrace:
		-
	-Genealogy that feels like a invented-to-flatter-some-noble one, but which your sire believes (right or wrong)?
	-You were _made_ for the Fire Dance!
		-Not just your Fortitude but also your Courage one short of max and your Path rating just
		 high enoungh for allowing the 5 the Dance would boost it to.
	-Sire follows Path of Honorable Accord, and largely cut you off when it was clear you would take
	 a more ambitious path.
		-You're still driven by hate and, now that yours has transferred to the Ventrue of the
		 Camarilla, it's paradoxically made you more like your famously ambitious kin.
	-Just beginning your rise. . .
		-"Sabbat social climber" is one of the seeds that led to this character.
