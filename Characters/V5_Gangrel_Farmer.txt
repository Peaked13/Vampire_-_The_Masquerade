Predator Type: Farmer

Flaws: (2 pts.)
	Shunned: 2 pt. Status Background Flaw
		-Shunned by Anarchs? Perhaps you're aligned with the Camarilla, despite the departure of
		 your clan from it as a whole, and were either loud about it or otherwise offended someone.
	Vegan: 2 pt. Flaw from Predator Type
		-You feed only on animal blood and must spend two points of Willpower to drink human blood.
Advantages: (7 pts., plus 5 for freebie XP)
	Merits:
		None
	Backgrounds:
		Allies: 4
			-Your employees on your farm.
			-2 pts. would reasonably represent a group of farm laborers, and 2 more pts. of
			 Reliability sounds about right for employees, but ones not on 24/7 on-call.
		Haven: 4
			-3 pts. towards size, 1 pt. towards Watchmen
			-Your resources gets you a lot here already, but more dots in this bacground could offer
			 add-ons.
			-Oh. This, instead of some resources dots, _would_ be a good way to represent having
			 the farm, a big chunk of capital, but not tons of liquid assets/cashflow.
			-Haunted might be an interesting flaw, if you need to free up a point.
		-Herd doesn't seem quite appropriate for you, with animals-via-Resources serving the purpose,
		 but that might be a Storyteller call.
		Resources: 2
			-You own a substantial farm or ranching operation, but most of your money is tied up in
			 that (and represented by Haven).
		Retainers: 2
			-Ghouled foreman on your farm.
