Disciplines: (None free due to Thin-blood)
	Presence: 1
		-Awe (1):
			-Add Presence to Persuasion, Performance, and other Charisma rolls at the Storyteller's
			 discretion at no cost.
			-If someone is aware they're being affected, they can resist for a scene with Composure +
			 Intelligence vs. your Manipulation + Presence.

		-Level 1 Formulas:
			-Haze (Core pg. 285):

				 a two dice penalty to identify you or hit you with ranged attacks.
				-A second Rouse Check extends the cloud to cover up to five people.

Predator Type: None due to Thin-blood

Flaws: (2 pts.)
	Mortal Frailty (Thin-blood):
		-You cannot Rouse the Blood to mend and instead heal as a mortal (see Core pg. 127).
	Bestial Temper (Thin-blood):
		-You frenzy as a full vampire.
	Clan Curse Brujah (Thin-blood):
		-One die penalty to resist fury frenzy (effective Bane Severity of 1), to a minimum pool of
		 one die.
Advantages: (7 pts.)
	Merits:
		Day Drinker (Thin-blood):
			-Sunlight halves your health and removes all vampiric abilities but does no other damage.
			-You still suffer hunger and need to sleep eventually.
			-If this causes your health to drop below your current damage levels, you suffer
			 Impairment or torpor until you're out of the sun.
		Discipline Affinity Presence (Thin-blood):
			-You can learn this discipline as an out-of-clan and start with a dot.
		Thin-blood Alchemist (Thin-blood):
			-You can learn this discipline and start with a dot.
	Backgrounds:
		-Definitely has Contacts.
		-Haven?
			-2 dots plus a third for a lab is minimum spend for a lab.
			-Maybe also with the 1 dot Creepy _haven_ Flaw?
			-Or combine with coterie and share a haven and/or domain?
		-Herd dots now have Resonance options that would be _very_ useful to a Thin-blood.
		-Mask, and maybe it's Cobbler add on could suit blackmarket / drugs. Would be 2 pts.
		-Resources of course.
		-Circulatory System Loresheet (Core pg. 386) sounds very interesting.
