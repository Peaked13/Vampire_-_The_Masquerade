Merits & Flaws:

		-Tied to Sadhu astrological practices, as briefly described on pg. 59 of Blood Sacrifice.
		-Your ritual allows you to overcome this somewhat, but at substantial cost.

	Oracular Ability (3 pt. Merit, Core 300)
	Prey exclusion (1 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 299)
		-Something tied to your ascetic practices?
		-Maybe you refuse to feed from vegetarians, _only_ feeding from carnivores, in a perversion
		 of mortal sadhus practicing vegetarianism, as befits the embodied demon you believe yourself
		 to be.

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-As a mortal:
		-Not a Brahmin in life, the Daitya's belief that all they embrace are _undead_ Brahmins is
		 a big deal to you, affecting your philosophy and beliefs about your role in the world.
		-Perhaps a criminal past?
			-Your abilities lean a bit in that direction. They're tied to your new unlife, but
			 there's likely a reason you have all those already, and little else.
	-Fled India at the beginning of The Week of Nightmares.
		-To someone with your oracular ability, the beginning was as loud as a trumpet, and only
		 grew worse from there. You had the occult knowledge to interpret the psychic onslaught,
		 and figured getting the whole planet between you and India would be wise.
