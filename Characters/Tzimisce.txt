Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-Large, powerful build. Somewhat overweight.
		-Never a looker to begin with, his use of Vicissitude on himself has made him terrible to behold
			-Functional modifications include both knuckle spikes and quills made with Bonecraft
			-It also leaves his apparent age ambiguous
	-As a mortal:
		-Reluctant apprentice/heir of his father, a butcher
			-Lacked both excitement and respect
			-Felt he *must* be destined for greater things
				-He admittedly was a bit too clever for a butcher, and for his own good
		-Got interested in the occult
			-He failed to escape his father's job, so sought escape and greater things here
		-Fell in with a group of mostly fraudulent occultists
			-Helped that he could provide. . . materials
			-It was here his sire found him, embracing him in his late thirties
	-His grandsire is a Koldun and follower of Metamorphosis, who took an interest in him
		-Survived awakening with his ancestral soil dependence by virtue of this
			-Grandsire recognized the symptoms and was able to obtain some suitable soil
				-The smell helped
			-Grandsire considers the trait a good omen
				-She does not possess it herself, nor does the sire
		-After discovering the flaw, she took a very active interest in his education
			-She's the source of his depth and breadth of Koldunic knowledge
			-She also helped set him down the Path of Metamorphosis
				-Though his mortal life primed him well for it
		-Eventually, she set him up with a pack of other Sabbat and turned him loose on the world
		 to pursue his metamorphosis
			-She gave him a basic education in the rituals of the Sabbat, and used her influence
			 to establish him as a pack priest
	-Sire took a less active role, especially after his swooped in
		-Maybe some resentment there?
		-Also involved with Koldunism to some degree
			-It's why he was fucking around with some mortal occultists
	-He seeks metamorphosis not just through Vicissitude, but also through Koldunic Sorcery
		-As he learns to bend both flesh and reality to his will, he finds it ever clearer that he
		 must will his way to metamorphosis
			-This is also tied to his nature
				-He views his calm in the midst of chaos as a triumph of his will
				-As such, he also seeks out such chaos, to further test and stretch his willpower

Equipment (stuff to start with or obtain):
	Koldunic ritual implements
	Body crafting "tools" (mostly, repurposed butcher's tools)
	Axe
		Oh shit. Storyteller's Companion lists a two handed sword as dealing Strenght+5, and
		wieldable one handed at Strenth 7+
	Stakes

Advancement:
	-Tentative schedule:
		6 for Melee 4
		7 for Koldunic Sorcery 2
			Way of Earth 2
		4 for Way of Spirit 2
		2 for Instinct 2
		4 for Instinct 3
		5 for Willpower 6
		14 for Koldunic Sorcery 3
			Way of Earth 3
		6 for Koldunism 4
		21 for Koldunic Sorcery 4
			Way of Earth 4
		6 for Willpower 7
		10 for Fortitude 1
		7 for Fortitude 2
		8 for Way of Spirit 3
		8 for Koldunism 5
		7 for Way of Fire 1
		4 for Way of Fire 2
		. . .
		If you can diablerize your way up to generation 7:
			20 for Visscitude 5
			25 for Visscitude 6
			If not, Protean may become more attractive
	-More Koldunism
		-Advance the discipline (current rating * 7)
			-The Way of Earth is probably the first priority for the free points
				-Every step is pretty great
			-More points in Spirit eventually will be nice too
				-Advancing paths without advancing the discipline looks to be (current rating * 4)
			-Fire is probably next most attractive, but Wind could also be good
				-New paths are 7
		-Learn more rituals
			-Koldunic, of course
				-There's a great level 4 one on pg. 133 of Secrets of Thaumaturgy
				-There's also a couple more on pg. 85 of Blood Sacrifice
					-Including a good level 1 ritual
				-There's more on pg. 98 of Sins of Blood too
					-Including a good level 1 ritual
				-Duplicated Thaumaturgy rituals is also probably an option
			-But maybe also Sabbat
				-Would it necessarily require the XP expenditure?
					-If so, then only if the story is going down this road, focusing on Sabbat politics
		-Eventually, advance the skill
			-That will be 8 XP, making it somewhat cheap, but probably behind various discipline related spending
	-Willpower (current rating)
	-Protean might be a useful discipline to pick up
		-Especially if game is more combat focused
		-Feral Claws and Eyes of the Beast both seem useful
		-Lots of multi-discipline powers involving this and Visscitude
			-Perhaps eventually get Body Armory, from pg. 111 of Guide to the Sabbat
				-20 XP to get and also requires Protean 3
				-Lets you build melee weapons from your body that do aggravated damage
					-Definitely sounds like they may be grafted to you
						-Unclear if they can be detached, but I'd expect so
					-Doesn't let you do the same to Ghouls and the like
			-I believe I saw other stuff in the Tzimisce book
		-Where do you learn it?
			-Signature of the Gangrel, whose Antitribu exist within the Sabbat
			-Seems like Tzimisce may commonly know it too
				-All those combined-with-Visscitude powers
				-They once enslaved the Gangrel, I think
		-Alternately, many of it's perks are obviated by levels 6+ of Vicissitude
	-Fortitude, Potence, and maybe Celerity are also attractive combat disciplines
		-Of them, Fortitude is probably most useful
	-Ghouls would be fun if you're stationary-ish
		-Obviously lots of potential with Visscitude
		-Not clear you need to put points in the background if you make them in game
		-Would then make Dominate attractive
	-Points in mentor might be useful
		-Representing coming back to your grandsire after proved success
			-The willingness of the grandsire to help, though, may actually indicate she's not all that
			 far along in, or invested in, the Path of Metamorphosis
				-Due to the fact that sharing knowledge is a sin at some of the highest ratings
		-Could be a source of new paths and disciplines
			-Maybe for advancement in them too, if that's actually required or otherwise helpful
				-I know in Mage the equivalent made XP costs a bit cheaper
