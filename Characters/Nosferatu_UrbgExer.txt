Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-Hideous, of course.
		-Not helping matters, your hands rarely end in anything other than claws, and are
		 invariably encrusted with dirt and other, less pleasant filth.
	-As a mortal:
		-Very much into urban exploration, you were fascinated by the various tunnels worming their
		 way beneath the city, and delighted in gaining access to them.
		-In retrospect, that clearly attracted the attention of the Nosferatu, leading to your
		 Embrace.
		-You were a college student at the time of your Embrace, with your field of study, Civil
		 Engineering, also tied to your hobby.
	-You're a tunnel digging specialist.
		-The Warrens of your city were a wonder to you and you are thrilled to both make your home
		 there and assist in their expansion.
	-Concerning your nature, you're quite happy to help your Clan in expanding and improving The
	 Warrens, but care less about the practicalities (and favors in return) than you let on. At
	 heart, you're still that UrbEx geek that can't wait to see what's beneath the surface.
