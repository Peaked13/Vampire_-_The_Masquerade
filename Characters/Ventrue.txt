Merits & Flaws:
	Bad Sight (1 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 297)
		Can wear glasses for it, or it would be more points
	Natural Leader (1 pt. Merit, Core pg. 300)
		2 extra dice for Leadership rolls
	Enchanting Voice (2 pt. Merit, Core pg. 296)
		-2 difficulty for "all die rolls involving the use of the voice to persuade, charm or command"
		As written, sounds like it should affect disciplines
			Though that certainly makes it powerful. As such many internet posts argued against it.

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-As a mortal:
		-
	-You took the idea of tech startup personality cults and ran with it
		-Your retainers and herd are all part of the network of small startups you control
			-Your herd talk of you having a dose of Steve Jobs's "reality distortion field". If only
			 they knew. . .
		-In fact, your feeding restriction (Ventrue weakness) is that you only drink from those
		 who hold options in one of your companies
			-Options being indicative of current employees, as opposed to shares sold to investors
				-Employees have been vetted in some way, and you hold high standards.
					-You *may* have also peeked at some medical and insurance records you really
					 shouldn't have access to. All the companies in your network are clients of your
					 HR Automation and medical-focused Employee Assistance Program (with "AI"!) ones.
				-Investors are often times those you plan to bilk, diverting the money to your own ends
				 from a company you plan to let fail
					-Others may be representative of other Kindred you've cut in on some deal
			-A less restrictive option would be something like programmers in general, should this
			 character be used for a more mobile game, where this would be unsuitable
