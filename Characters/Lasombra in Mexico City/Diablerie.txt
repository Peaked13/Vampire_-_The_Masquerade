-Revised rules start on page 224 of Core
	-Extended strength roll (difficulty 9) will determine how fast you can perform the diablerie,
	 once all blood is drained.
		-Thus, Potence would help a lot. Can you increase Maria's in time to help?
-Thaumaturgy will even tell you how much blood remains.
-Options for burning blood, to make room:
	-Obtenebration:
		-Shadow Play can even be before you take a taste. Your shadows move anyways; no way this is
		 noticed.
		-A shroud, even not costing blood, could be useful for buying time.
	-You can spend blood to boost your physical attributes.
		-Max of gen-limit plus one will last for the scene, so up to 6.
			-Also something you might want to do before even taking a taste.
		-You can also go beyond those limits, which will last for 3 turns _after you stop spending
		 blood on it_.
			-The example on page 138 of Core is instructive, describing an 11th gen. Cainite boosting
			 strength to 9, spending blood over multiple turns, and it then lasting for 3 turns after
			 he "levels out".
		-Strength is obviously a useful thing to boost for this.
-You're currently 10th generation, and even a bump of one would make a huge difference.
	-Gets you to spending two blood a turn, making Focused Mind fully useful and Black Metamorphosis
	 doable in a single turn.
-If you can't have that husk now, can you return to the subject later?
	-You should still have a Heart, hanging out in the shadows of your jacket. Try to hide it on
	 the husk, to later guide you to it?
		-It follows your "spoken will", though, which could complicate instructing it to do this.


I must confess (though I won't to anyone else, lol) that Maria's suggestion that she taste the staked husk is not entirely innocent. It'll potentially mean her being the first one to learn information, the helpless husk's generation, that would tempt _any_ Cainite. She has also been stymied thus far in her (admittedly a bit oblique) attempts to secure a guarantee that bartering Thaumaturgy to her sire for more abyssal secrets won't step on any toes, and knows that. . . communion will also help her grow closer to her dark love. Taking a little something for herself is just fair, looked at in that light, right? (lol)

There's definitely some chance Maria might try to immediately fall upon this vampire and drain it, after tasting it, or attempt to return to the matter later, if she doesn't believe she can manage it now.
