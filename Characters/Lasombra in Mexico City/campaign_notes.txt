11/2/20: The Pala Grande
	-We were brought together at the event
	-We're a new pack, put together to pay a debt on behalf of one of those backing me, to The
	 Sorcerers of the Tiocali.
		-The Sachiriel are the Abyss Mystics asking me to do this. Not sure what they have on the
		 others, but the more lucid of the two clear knew he was supposed to be there.
			-I, at least, am willing to please if there's hope of getting Abyss secrets out of it.
		-I seem to have known to expect the other two.
	-We participated in the fire dance, and made a good showing of ourselves, though Dardunas needed
	 a Tzimice to push him forward.
	-Afterwards, the Regent, Melinda Galbraith approached us.
		-She complemented us on the performance, and handed us a key, asking her to meet her in her
		 trailer, after the event.
	-The Sorcerers of the Tiocali
		-Esteban
			-Most powerful among them, he's a genuine Thaumaturge.
		-La Viuda Blanca (The White Widow in Spanish)
			-A decrepit skeleton in a wedding dress, with a scythe.
			-We definitely see her at the event.
		-Others likely exist, but these were the well known ones named.
		-I believe we were also told they had set up shop in the former chantry of the now-gone
		 Tremere antitribu.
	-After speaking with the regent, we went over to La Viuda Blanca and explained we'd been sent
	 to pay a debt.
		-She suggested we should first prove ourselves against another pack.
	-We put together a Game of Instinct, a game of soccer (more a soccer brawl) against a pack
	 looking to cut us down after the favorable attention.
		-"The Lizzies"
			-lol
	-Max punched through one of their lungs, while Dardunas repeatedly kicked the "ball" (a severed
	 head) into the face of another.
		-It exploded the second time, to laughs all around.
		-She, meanwhile, hit me with Max.
		-In the end, with two of them down, Max intimidated the remaining one, and we wer victorious.
	-That counted as proving ourselves. When we went to see La Viuda Blanca again, she accepted our
	 service and announced to the gathered Sabbat that this pack is protected by The Sorcerers of
	 the Tiocali.


Questions to ask before next session:
	-With new folks joining, are we continuing the story from our last session or starting over in
	 some fashion?
		-Continuing where we left off.
	-What year is it?
		-2020
	-Details of sins for The Path of Night:
		-Is killing mortals an issue for me _at all_?
			-My path score is low enough that _no_ killing will lower it, but I'm wondering both for
			 the future and because I figure I should be at least _trying_ to adhere to the whole of
			 the path, even if I'm not so far along that higher sins would shake my convictions.
			-What I'm having trouble parsing, though, is that lower sins include killings, making
			 distinctions about whether it's intentional or not, but the score 10 sin for the _normal_
			 version of the path (left off my Lightless version) is, "Killing a mortal for food."
				-Does killing mortals simply not count for the lower numbered sins, those sins only
				 worrying about killing other _Kindred_? Or is it that it's kosher so long as you eat
				 what you kill, until you reach a path score of 10 (or always, in my Lightless case)?
		-Answer:
			-It's the latter. Followers of the path understand if you occasionally drain them in a
			 frenzy. You shouldn't be aiming to, though.
	-What are the details of those restrictions on Abyss Mysticism rituals again?
		-I wasn't able to find a reference for that in any of the books I've looked at, but Abyss
		 Mysticism _is_ definitely scattered all over the place. I'm also fine with limiting them
		 simply for balance or story reasons. They're certainly powerful.
		-My interest here is also related to the blood stuff above. Maria _loves_ The Abyss, and
		 uses her Obtenebration and rituals to feel closer to her beloved Ahriman. Blood is
		 critically necessary for fueling that, and she's inclined to basically squander it, even
		 as The Abyss's marks on her make obtaining it more difficult. Drinking the Blood of Ahriman,
		 in particular, is her heroin, communion, and steroids, all together, so I want to figure
		 out the details.
		-Answer:
			-3+ needs room with blackened mirrors on all sides of the room.
			-You do have access to a place like that, but it's in the domain of the leader of the
			 Sachiriel, in the sewers of Mexico City.
				-He'll let you in there once a week, on Sunday, but any more than that would entail
				 asking him for a boon.
	-How secretive are the Kindred I've been exposed to where Abyss Mysticism is concerned?
		-Maria is inclined to evangelize, and the Sabbat seem inclined to share Disciplines (maybe
		 with some help from all the shared blood), but I've also seen refrences to the Lasombra
		 being generally unwilling to share the rituals and secrets of Abyss Mysticism. How did
		 Maria's original mentor feel about this, the one from her background that set her down
		 this path? What about the Sachiriel and those Lasombra she associates with now?
		-Answer:
			-Yeah, the Lasombra are eager to share Obtenebration, but keep the rituals of Abyss
			 Mysticism to themselves.
			-Additionally, heard more about the Sachiriel.
				-They're a subfaction of the Family of the Night, the Abyss Mystics faction within
				 Clan Lasombra.
				-They're extremists, dedicated to The Path of Night.
	-Pasted the above into Discord.
	-Sent the following also, about equipment:
		-Oh, the other thing in the back of my head, which I hadn't yet written down:
			-I was wondering how starting equipment works, but failed to bring it up last session.
			 Maria is resource-less, but I'm looking to figure out what in the way of her ritual
			 implements she already has, and which she needs to acquire. I think the full list
			 is a knife used only for the Vaulderie, some cheap unused knives (Drinking the Blood
			 of Ahriman), and a lighter and candle (The Shadown of Hands That Serve).
		-Answer:
			-You can basically start with stuff you could reasonably steal without police following
			 up. All of your ritual implements would be fine to start with.
	-We then talked about it in voice.
	-What's the duration of Obtenebration powers?
		-Only the first lists a duration. Are the rest a scene? Indefinite? Different for
		 different powers?
		-Answer: "usually only a scene"


11/30/20: 
	-Esteban ripped Dardunas in half.
		-Apparently he was caught planting some sort of bug.
		-(Fen had to bow out of the game.)
	-A Grimaldi ghoul walked over afterwards, to make sure we understood this demonstation of the
	 consequences of stealing the sorcerers' secrets.
		-He also offered us help as a fixer, for a price to be named. . .
		-Might be a good option for finding a pack haven.
			-We raised the issue with him.
				-He suggested the tract houses in $AREA, due to minimal police presence, plentiful
				 feeding, and constructed in a way that would be bullet proof.
		-He also asked us to help with another matter. 
			-A neonate, zi-zi-mi-su (or something like that), claims to have information of interest
			 to the sorcerers, and they would like us to check it would.
				-Tzitzimitl, pronounced "zit zee me tul"
			-She hunts in another area of the city, some slums, and is known to be somewhat. . .
			 flamboyant.
				-She has a conjoined twin.
			-Sounds like we have our task.
	-We did gain two more packmates, though.
		-Dr. Tobias Weber of Clan Tzimice.
		-Xander "La Hiena" Curtros, a city Gangrel.
			-"The Hyena"
			-"I earned it in prison."
	-We also went to our meeting with the Regent.
		-We also saw her earlier, talking to two others: Jolan, a Tzimice, voice of The Moderates,
		 and Veneri Carboni, a Toreador, and voice of The Status Quo.
			-Jolan is known as "The Mother of Horrors", though it's gender changes regularly, and
			 returned the vozhd to The Sabbat of Mexico City.
		-They said something about a shipment, that The Black Hand must not find out about.
			-Jolan later mentioned that, if anyone finds out, it means their heads.
			-I botched a roll, though, and am a clueless idiot where The Hand is concerned.
				-I mostly know they're dark and terrible, that they hunt other vampires, and that
				 they were harnessed somehow by The Sabbat.
		-We approached her trailer, guarded by Paladins.
			-They let us in after Maximo brandished the key we were given.
			-Even before we got to the door, she came out and hurried us in.
			-She seems freaked out.
			-Shit. That is not Melinda Galbraith.
				-Underneath was some male Cainite using Visscitude.
				-He's keeping Galbraith's ashes in a mini-fridge nearby.
					-Some investigation suggests she was somehow incinerated.
				-He also pointed to some wierd bat winged design, painted in blood on the wall.
				-Shit. He's famous too, among mortals and Sabbat both.
					-He's thought to be a leading plastic surgeon, but in reality is a Visscitude
					 master instead.
				-I froze a bit, but Maximo and La Hiena discussed turning him in.
				-He did _not_ like that, and lunged for the door.
					-Max and La Hiena beat the shit out of him and staked him.
	-We ran outside for the Paladins.
		-They fetched Veneri Carboni who calmed the crowd outside with Presence, and then began our
		 interrogation.
		-I recounted our story and La Hiena got his mind probed.
		-Veneri believes us, after the probing, but warned us not all will, and that there is now a
		 target on our back.
		-He offered his help.
			-He spoke of the sorcery of the now-gone Tremere, and claimed that anyone who managed to
			 rediscover it could easily be named the next regent.
			-He'd rather the chantry and their sorcery remain undiscovered, and wanted us to destroy
			 or hide any evidence of it.
			-The bastard wanted us to literally kiss the ring, on top of swearing it.
				-All but Maximo were willing to do it.
	-We figured we better end this shit show of a night, and find a haven in the area the Grimaldi
	 ghoul suggested.
		-First, we stole a minivan, now sans driverside door.
		-As we were told, amidst the slums of Cuidad $SOMETHING, there's a set of tract homes in
		 surprisingly good condition.
			-There's even a few empty ones.
			-They have thick plastic windows and heavy steel doors with big deadbolts. Home invasion
			 proofing for the Mexican working class, tied to the surrounding slums.
			-It's also relatively fire resistant.
	-The next morning was a Sunday, 11/1/20, so I dragged my pack to church.
		-We descended deep beneath the cities surface, via a side door on an old church, and found
		 the Sachiriel in their sewer complex.
		-We did indeed attend a black mass, where Zadkiel Ben Aron led a sermon concerning the
		 tenants of The Path of Night.
		-He also performed communion, in which all of the party save the Doctor participated.
			-Seems like it's a modified version of Pierce the Murk.
			-We get controllable Nightsight for the night.
		-Afterwards, I was able to perform Drinking the Blood of Ahriman, in the ritual chamber
		 beneath the pool of water around the statue.
			-I had to promise Zadkiel a favor later this week.
	-We then found our target, who was quite helpful.
		-It mentioned that a pack had stolen something of interest to The Sorcerers.
			-A book stolen from the Tremere.
			-They have used it to sell themselves to a demon.
		-There's bad blood there, as that pack had drained this creature's herd on many occasions.
			-They swear, though, this is not just revenge on their part.
		-They want help in recovering the book.
		-The pack is Gregorio's Diabolical Dreamtime Show
			-They're Malkavians with a traveling carnival.
		-Did she say something about helping us with a ritual? "The Bitter Rose"?
			-That rings an amazingly good bell in my recollections of source books. . .
	-We knocked over a tailor, after we got some cryptic message from Maximo's detective contact,
	 which he had asked to investigate the circus, telling us to show up in suits.
		-We grabbed the lockbox, but haven't yet investigated it.
		-We also failed to get more details from this detective, who said he was "busy" when Maximo
		 replied to his text.
	-We left off just before attending the circus.


-Stuff for next session:
	-Don't forget that Drinking the Blood of Ahriman also lowers the difficulties of the first three
	 Obtenebration powers by -2 and makes better arms a bit cheaper.
	-Carnival prep:
		-Are we going to announce ourselves to the Malkavians?
			-If so, should we bring snacks or entertainment? Maybe some gang members?
		-Can we trust this stuff about showing up in suits?
			-Could be a trick. Are we confident the texts come from that contact?
		-We need to find this book somehow.
		-Could we cut power to the carnival? All but the abstaining Dr. can see in the dark.


12/14/20: A Trip to the Circus
	-We're all a bit unsure about this suit gambit, but we're going for it.
	-We decided we'd be fairly open about being Cainites at the circus, at least with the Malkavians.
		-As such, we decided to go along with my suggestion of bringing snacks.
		-We pulled the minivan up alongside a game of dice, in the area around our haven, and
		 convinced them to get into the van.
		-After meeting me, they needed some more convincing.
			-One of them took a swing at Maximo trying to escape.
			-They quieted down when I spoke up (using Intimidate).
	-After that, we went to the carnival.
		-Maximo's swat raid was already there.
		-As such, I snuck over the fence, rather than have them talk with my freaky self.
		-We are making a miserable mess of attempting to sneak around this place.
		-Maximo broke the lock on an office, but the most exciting thing he found was a list of
		 kills and drinks for three names:
			Alexis
			Felipe
			Wakim
		-The other three ducked into the hall of mirrors, inside a tent
			-La Hiena found a seem in a mirror, and opened a secret room full of corpses, occult
			 paraphanelia, and a likely looking book.
			-They carried it out under a suit jacket.
		-I, meanwhile, investigated some of the tents near the center.
			-One has a freaky old fortune telling machine in the center, along with a black trunk.
			-The trunk has some kind of arcane diagram made out of candles and fingers on it.
			-I wisely left it untouched for now, going in search of the others.
		-Alexis the clown caught La Hiena with the book, though, alerting Mr. Vera. He, in turn,
		 called to some kind of master for help, and all hell broke loose.
			-The sky is wonky and blinding bright. Clouds are scabs raining filthy snow on us. The
			 ground pulses with it's own terrible hearbeat.
			-Worse, we heard Alexis yell something about _books_.
		-Battle began.
			-Most of them jumped La Hiena, though several went chasing after Dr. Weber as he went
			 to hide.
			-I created a Shroud covering a 50' diameter, and hits got a bit scarcer.
			-Reality itself seemed to strike out at us each turn, mouths appearing in the ground and
			 biting us or gravity briefly reversing and then slamming us into the ground.
			-A couple of them did manage to sink their fangs into La Hiena, but my next turn brought
			 forth five Arms from the Shroud, which promptly pulped Mr. Vera, the seeming leader,
			 and grabbed Alexis the Clown.
				-The tentacles were actually attached La Hiena, who then promptly shredded the clown
				 attached to him.
				-Disgustingly, Alexis was full of maggots, rather than blood.
			-Unfortunately, a babbling homeless woman, Old Smelly Culo, managed to scare off most of
			 us, after forcing us to make a Self-Control roll.
				-Already frenzying La Hiena was conveniently immune.
					-And also seems to be somehow extra terrifying when frenzied, with extra Potence
					 and other dots, along with growing bigger and hairier.
					-He eventually took care of Culo for us, but Culo was sadly also chock full of
					 maggots, so he didn't manage to feed and sooth his frenzy.
			-I eventually recovered my senses just in time for me to witness the little Javier
			 prick summoning some kind of nightmare.
				-Too many limbs, no skin, and bent over backwards.
			-I examined the contents of that trunk I had a tentacle open for me, but no book was
			 contained within, just some miscellaneous ritual implements.
			-Hearing more chanting from Javier, I joined Maximo in kicking him around.
				-Another batch of Arms made short work of him.
			-With Javier gone, the summoned creature disappeared and reality calmed.
			-We grabbed the book and ran for the minivan, while someone took pot shots over our
			 head.
		-Back in the minivan, I asked Max for the book and examined it.
			-It's written in Enochian, and seems to be a demon worship how-to.
			-It's full of rituals involving blood sacrifice, flaying, and the worship of Shlobal
			 (or something like that; sounds Aztec).
				-It was Xolotl.
			-Crucially, it's not the fucking book we were looking for!
				-Which is a journal of some kind.
		-Back to the fucking carnival. . .
			-One of the last tents we had not checked is the big one.
			-Strangely, despite the commotion outside and the fact that the rest of the area is
			 now empty of people, animal noises and voices come from inside the tent.
			-La Heina peeked inside, and the inside is strange.
				-A clown with a machete guards the door.
				-A bunch of especially disturbing circus freaks chanted baby talk.
					-"Chernobyl baby look"
				-He didn't see a book, though, so we opted to avoid it if we can.
			-We returned to the hall of mirrors, for a more. . . aggressive search.
				-It's freakier too. The mirrors no longer reflect, but act as windows onto some
				 kind of nightmare world.
					-Flesh trees, sky of roiling darkness, and hideous monsters, many of them
					 similar to the summoned thing.
					-Poking one of them felt like pressing your hand against some thick liquid,
					 like you could push through it. . . 
				-We returned to the secret room in the mirror maze, and opened some of the coffins.
					-We found two books within.
						-One, leather with a silk bookmark, had an image of 9 skulls on it forming
						 a circle, with 4 in a cross inside the circle.
							-Looking at it later, it looks to be a copy of the Book of Nod.
							-With some amount of crazy conspiracy theorist marginelia and newspaper
							 clippings.
						-The other, brown leather, has an attached pen and bits of newspaper
						 sticking out.
							-Opening it, it does indeed seem to be the journal of a woman in her
							 twenties.
							-She's collecting news articles about murder victims drained of
							 blood. . .
							-Certain letters, though, are actually strange symbols, which suggest
							 an arcane cipher.
			-We booked it (heh) back to the minivan.
		-Back in the van, I examined the books further.
			-Some decent Int plus Occult and Linguistics rolls let me break much of the cipher.
				-I dug into it back at the haven, and found it specified some coordinates.
				-They're actually nearby. Some Google Maps work found it points to a grain silo
				 on a none too distant farm.
	-We went to the silo the next night, after drinking some blood.
		-We found it where we expected it and, using the journal's information, we opened a secret
		 door, leading to stairs downward.
		-They led to a series of Last Crusade-style trials, but, much like the movie, the journal
		 let us bypass them easily.
		-Past the trials, we found a vault door, but the journal provided the code and it opened
		 onto a huge tunnel, with more vault doors, opening at the same time, every ~40 ft.
			-The walls are lined with shelves housing countless books, and the shelves are covered
			 in Enochian script.
			-Part of the floor has a Tremere symbol, surrounded by Enochian text as well.
			-There are also roughly 200 pillars of salt, in roughly human shapes. . .


-Stuff to figure out for next time:
	-Find out when you can spend some XP.
		-You've got 14 now, one short of Potence _2_.
			-_Probably_ the way to go, rushing for Dark Steel.
			-No teacher involved, it being a clan discipline, but can I basically learn it overnight?
		-Still, if more rituals can be had, you might do some of that first.
			-You can potentially do a level one or two ritual _and_ Potence 1.
	-How much of the trials and such to enter the chantry could the rest of the pack replicate,
	 given that I'm the one with Occult and the one who translated the cipher?
		-I might be inclined to keep something back from them, if possible.
			-Three can keep a secret, if two are dead. . .
			-Vinculum (highest is 7 with Maximo, others are 5) _might_ pose an issue, though I've
			 got a rationalization ready at hand: Really, it's _best_ for them if they cannnot give
			 up every secret. If captured by some faction, they'd surely be killed the moment they
			 get access to the chantry. Better to remain useful, as bait for me, if nothing else. . .
		-Answered: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/790323695414935582
	-What of the creature that set us on the path to this journal?
		-Look up the details above under "We then found our target, who was quite helpful."
	-Abyssal guardian for the chantry?
	-Figure out background details in light of your sire's identity.
		-Zadkiel's interests in this all?
			-Talking to Lesley, just like everyone else, he wants thaumaturgical secrets, and other
			 help from the Sorcerer's magics.
			-Other magical systems also offer options for adaptation or insight. It could benefit one's
			 understanding of The Abyss.


12/14/20: 
	-After some debate, we opted to explore the chantry a bit further.
	-Part of our proof this is our target is a bunch of journals, written by Sabbat Tremere, near the
	 entrance of the chantry.
		-No entries date to later than Halloween of 1997, when many mention being being recalled to
		 the chantry by someone named Goratrix.
			-Sabbat Lore revealed Goratrix was the leader to the Tremere antitribu.
	-Just inside the entryway stood a portrait of someone named Ein, and a journal bearing the same
	 name. aurel
	-We also saw 3 doors, numbered 1 through 3.
	-In another room, we found some kind of demonic looking entity, surrounded by three pillars of
	 salt, apparently in the middle of casting some kind of spell.
		-It's apparently motionless.
		-That room also featured a journal by someone called Aurel of the Seven.
			-It features a lot of German passages, but they have several written translations into
			 various languages, including Spanish, written into the book.
			-The author was apparently an alchemist who travelled in India, and it features various
			 recipes.
			-Efforts to photograph it's pages failed, though. The text was not visible and, on
			 video it didn't even look like a book, just a pile of rotting paper.
	-The opposite side of the chantry featured it's own demonic monster, frozen still and
	 surrounded by ex-Tremere.
		-It has it's own multi-lingual journal, by someone named Dragon's Envy.
			-It was another member of The Seven, the leadership of House Goratrix.
			-It claims to be a "Black Spiral Dancer", and it traded a number of the rituals of the
			 were-creatures to Goratrix in exchange for the embrace.
			-It also references dealings with some great spirit known as "Typhon", claiming that
			 several Thaumaturgical paths were derived from knowledge gained from the spirit.
				-Paths of Destruction, Weather Manipulation, and others.
	-We grabbed both of the magic journals, and returned to Ein's up front.
		-Utilizing Auspex and a smart phone's camera, it does indeed have the same magical
		 properties.
	-Door #2 featured a small room full of shelves of books, all featuring those same auras.
		-They appear to be grimoires, rather than journals.
	-Door #1 was much the same, save a salt pillar destroyed in the middle of removing or placing
	 a book on the shelves.
	-Among one of the many shelves of journals, we found a shelf labeled "Concerning Gratiano"
		-How could I not know the name of Lasombra's slayer?
		-Leafing through them a bit, they seem very concerned with whether or not Gratiano managed
		 to diablerize Lasombra, with the consensus being that he likely failed.
	-Door #3 led to a trail of blood and bloody footprints, leading to stairs going downwards.
		-Thankfully, it's old and dry.
		-Shelves leading up to the stairs hold books with an aura of their own, somewhat different
		 from the others.
			-An attempt to photograph them led to La Hiena's phone heating up alarmingly before
			 he stopped.
			-They appear to be journals, but all by only seven authors.
				-They all appear to be leaders of the Tremere antitribu.
				-Those with the strongest aura were authored by Goratrix himself.
		-The area the stairs led to is also, of coure, filled with bookshelves, but these have had
		 the books scattered.
			-In the center, there is a pentagram scribed in blood, several pillars of salt (one
			 holding a mirror), and various mangled corpses, some of which appear to be part man,
			 part wolf.
			-Two books also lay near the pentagram that held magical auras.
				-The one to the left was overwhelming, and felt dangerous.
			-As Dr. Weber looked into the mirror, he saw a robed figure standing near him,
			 glaring at the mirror.
				-The rest of us, though, were unable to see the figure.
				-As the Dr. described the figure to us, it seemed to take notice of him, and
				 began to stare back at him, _from_ the mirror.
				-At that moment, with the figure now facing him, the Dr. became convinced it
				 was, in fact, Goratrix, though _aged_.
				-Speaking aloud, Dr. Weber asked the figure if he was indeed Goratrix.
					-It responded by holding a finger to it's mouth, and than walking over to
					 a toppled bookshelf and pointing at it.
					-La Heina righted the shelf, and the figure began looking through the books
					 remaining on the shelf, eventually pointing to an empty spot on the shelves.
					-Moving the books near there around, La Heina found an invisible cup.
						-Removing it from the shelf, it became a visible silver cup.
						-Examining it, it looked to me like one of the four Hermetic weapons,
						 The Chalice, representing water.
					-The figure then moved to another shelf, making the shape of a dagger or cross
					 with it's hands. Going to the same place, La Heina did indeed find a ritual
					 knife with an obsidian blade.
					-It then proceeded onto another spot, making a shape resembling an hour glass or
					 bag with it's hands. There was indeed a small, velvet bag atop one of the books
					 on the top shelf, containing what looks like crushed up bug shells.
					-La Heina proposed adding the shells and a bit of his vitae to the cup, and the
					 figure began nodding.
						-It indicated, though, that the Dr. should instead contribute _his_ vitae.
					-Upon doing so, the runes on the cup began to glow, the vitae became a purple
					 mist, and a large slug began to climb from the cup.
						-Holding the slug up to his ear, the Dr. could hear a voice, which instructed
						 him to place it atop his ear.
						-After doing so, he could clearly hear the figure.
						-The figure inquired as to the year.
						-Dr. Weber asked if he was indeed Goratrix, which he did claim to be, saying
						 that the ghost of Tremere had cast him from his body, stealing it.
						-Dr. Weber also asked about the particularly ominous book, which Goratrix
						 said was warded, such that an unauthorized reader would go mad.
						-Goratrix even offered to teach us Thaumaturgy, if we would use it to
						 revenge himself upon the Tremere.
							-He also desires freedom, but only Tremere himself could grant it.
						-He also spoke of changes he witnessed in Tremere before he left.
							-Tremere would wake with a third eye and, in sleep, would turn into a
							 great one-eyed worm, reverting upon waking.
						-He even spoke of the creature Tremere diablerized, the gorgon Saulot, whose
						 cyclopes were said to eat souls.
							-Goratrix suspected, however, that they also held insights into spirits.
						-He also fear The Eldest's influence may be within Tremere as well, on
						 account of the Tzimice blood that they used to achieve vampirism.
						-Expressing interest in his thaumaturgical teachings, Goratrix suggested that
						 I may be able to utilize the same sympathetic magic, if I've recently
						 participated in The Vaulderie with the Dr.
							-I eagerly complied.
						-Goratrix also notified that there was another still in these halls that could
						 aid us, a Nosfertu knowledgeable about the rituals of the were-creatures.
							-They felt he may be useful later, so they kept him staked behind an
							 illusary wall. Goratrix believed that Tremere's magics did not likely
							 affect him.
							-Galen is joining us, with his character, Sordido.
	-We retrieved staked Sordido, fed him some of La Heina's blood and then the blood of The
	 Vaulderie, then woke him and did some introductions. We then took him down to the basement.
		-He identified the two werewolves as a Silver Fang and a Shadow Lord, nobles of their kind.
			-He suggested the Tremere must have traveled far to obtain their like, and that they
			 appear to have used their blood for the ritual circle.
	-We then talked further with Goratrix.
		-We revealed to him that Veneri Carboni wanted us the keep the chantry buried.
			-He suggested the use of two blue ribbons, found in the left summoning chamber above.
			-They will turn Presence back upon it's user.
		-We discussed our next steps.
			-I suggested we proceed cautiously, but immediately dive into the secrets of Thaumaturgy.
			-I also suggested that we obtain blood, for the study (and my crazy hunger).
				-Goratrix informed us that the chantry was well stocked, of course.
					-It is in a vault beneath a magic circle in the SE portion of the upper level.
						-A drop of blood opens it.
						-The blood in the amphoras below will spoil at its normal rate once opened,
						 so they should be opened one at a time.
				-Dr. Weber has. . . gorier requirements, but Goratrix suggested the organs of their
				 albino alligator revenants.
					-In exchange for the blood from the amphoras, they willingly offered their organs.
			-I asked too about if the wards would interfere with an abyssal summoning.
				-He suggested that the wards would permit it in the NE summoning chambers.
	-After drinking, I wandered over to the summoning chambers, and summoned a Heart That Beats
	 in Silence.
		-I got two successes on the Intelligence+Occult roll, so it will last two nights.
		-I told it to defend us while we sleep, and attack anyone else who entered the basement.
	-We then slept.
		-Strangely, we dreamed.
		-We dreamed of cyclopean floating stones, tentacled, many-eyed darkness gibbering blasphemy,
		 and Goratrix reaching his hands out to it.
			-It also reminded us of the scene with the Malkavians at the carnival.
			-Even the Heart seems to have had the same, seemingly emanating from the mirror.
			-Confronting Goratrix about it, he seemed to have no knowledge of what happened.
				-Or at least is a damned good liar (probably is). . .
				-He suggested it could be related to the magic of the mirror, unknown to him.
			-We mentioned it reminded us of the work of the Malkavians at the carnival, telling him
			 that they were worshippers of Xolotl.
				-He recognized the name, suggesting perhaps that contact with it may have been
				 responsible for this.
				-He also spoke of their beliefs as to where these great spirits came from, including
				 Kuppala as well.
	-I then set about on a Goratrix-suggested reading list, an intro to Thaumaturgy, while resting
	 up and healing that aggravated damage from my ritual.
		-Sordido joined me in this.
		-The training involved Goratrix guiding us through scattered sections of various journals.
		-He also mentioned some of the research the chantry had been doing.
			-In the course of that, he mentioned that it would be possible to learn _Dark_
			 Thaumaturgy from the trapped creatures above.
			-He mentioned it off-handedly, but that is a grave thing to mention. . .
	-The rest of the pack ran various errands.
		-I don't know that I like the attention that'll attract, but I also didn't know the extent
		 of it (and maybe still don't?).
		-Maximo went off to his sire/mentor to abandon Humanity, so I don't think he's back before
		 morning.
		-Yep, all but Maximo came back that night. No one had a clear idea where he went, though 
		 La Hiena thinks he said something about his sire.
	-On waking, I nearly frenzied, on acount of blood for aggravated damage _and_ Ahriman, but
	 resisted (with some help from Willpower) and ran for the amphoras.
		-Sordido wisely suggested that these amphoras might be rather valuable to waste.
			-He had a good point, and I agreed, though I cautioned him that we must balance that
			 against the need to keep the chantry hidden.
			-19 amphoras remain unopened, containing 20 blood points each.
	-We didn't see Maximo for another week.
		-We texted him, but only got back "Busy".
		-During that time, Sordido and I continued our studies, while La Hiena retrieved a series
		 of kine for our. . . use.
		-Goratrix also continued our training.
			-He is indeed teaching Sordido and I Thaumaturgy.
			-He taught us how to unlock the madness tome, to avoid the derangement.
			-See the "Grand Grimoire of Goratrix" and "all of the grimoires" handouts
				-They're _crazy_!
		-Maximo eventually returned, wearing an uncharacteristically nice suit.
	-We'll have been training from shortly after Halloween until when the game resumes.


-XP spend: 34
	10	Thaumaturgy 1
	7	Thaumaturgy 2
	10	Potence 1
	5	Potence 2?
			-Hmm. . . Dark Steel is cheap (18 XP), but requires _2_ blood to use, limiting it a fair
			 bit without Diablerie.
	4	Self-Control 3?
			-Do I need training?
				-Nope!
	-Looks like all my above plans are possible, though no answer on rituals as of yet: https://discord.com/channels/772879016822046721/772879017257992192/794426179125641246
	7	Path of Focused Mind
			-Good for making a physical attack before anyone else, and good for favor trading.
	?	Rituals!
			-Got my answer as to accessible, and they cost 1 XP per level: https://discord.com/channels/772879016822046721/772879017257992192/796053293582385203
			-Can take up to 5 XP worth. Max that out, probably.
				-Plus the one free _per dot_.
					-I think I've seen that in a different edition, and it means one free _of a
					 level up to your newly gained dot_.
			-Attractive and available:
				1:
					Illuminate Trail of Prey
						-Guide to The Sabbat pg. 119
						-Probably a top candidate.
					Epistle of Babel
						-Low Clans pg. 169
						-Magic encryption.
					Purity of Flesh
						-Low Clans pg. 169
						-Eh. OK, but not amazing.
				2:
					Burning Blade
						-Low Clans pg. 169
						-Does anyone have ranks in Melee?
					Recure of the Homeland
						-Guide to The Sabbat pg. 119
						-Easy aggravated healing!
						-Only reason it's not a deifinite choice is the need to obtain earth from
						 the town of your mortal birth.
					Machine Blitz
						-Guide to The Sabbat pg. 119
						-Casting time (standard is 5 min. per level of ritual) limits it, though.
					Transubstantiation of Humors
						-Low Clans pg. 170
						-_Very_ thematic, but not amazing effect. Hard to drink your blood, because
						 it turns it into noxious black bile. +1 difficulty to social rolls, though.
			-How about spending 3 points, and your free 1st and 2nd level ones, on:
				Illuminate Trail of Prey
				Epistle of Babel
				Burning Blade
				Recure of the Homeland
	-So, final spend:
		17	Thaumaturgy 1 & 2
		10	Potence 1
		3	Rituals
		That leaves 4 XP from the 34 I had, which seems worth saving for Abyss Mysticism rituals.
-I also followed up with Lesley about the Gratiano books in the chantry, here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/797696376447303700
	-They disturbingly suggest Lasombra may still exist. . .


1/11/21:
	-Months later, after our time spent in the chantry. . .
		-The Sabbat in Mexico city have nearly descended into civil war, after the destruction of 
		 Regent Galbraith.
			-Various factions have emerged, most led by a priscus.
				-Joseph Pander leads a faction of Loyalists.
					-The faction is naturally mostly Panders.
					-Mexico city is densely populated by Cainites, with something like 600 vampires
					 in the city.
					-Pander is largely responsible for this, bringing many fanatics into the city
					 that advocate loyalty only to their packs and a "Ductus Priori" who has proved
					 himself worthy.
						-Pander is who they recognize as Ductus Priori.
				-There are also The Moderates, led by Jolan.
					-They think The Code of Milan is decent, but that The Purchase Pact was bullshit.
						-The Pact is that "Statutes added to the revised Code of Milan" bit at the
						 bottom of the Milan handout in Roll20.
					-They like The Sabbat, but also aren't adverse to war within it.
						-The defeated clearly deserved it. If rabble can take them down, what chance
						 do they have against antediluvians?
					-The Sorcerers of Tiocali are considered part of The Moderates.
				-Then there are the Ultraconservatives, led by the Lasombra Charles IV.
					-Many are ancient Tzimice. and deeply religious Cainites.
					-Louis IV is fond of behaving like a medieval knight, going attired appropriately
					 into battle and such.
				-Zadkiel is a leader among the religious ones, The Orthodoxy.
					-The Lasombra used to dominate The Orthodoxy but, in a parallel to The
					 Inquisition, the Slubri have begun to supplant them.
					-Their involvement in politics is somewhat minimal, being more focused
					 on their Path of Night.
				-The Status Quo we've met, led by Veneri Carboni.
					-They think everything is just fine, and mean to keep it that way.
			-Our pack, or those among us with any interest in politics, seem to lean towards aligning
			 with The Moderates.
				-The Sorcerers are with them, and they already back us to some degree, and can also
				 best utilize what we've found in the chantry.
	-After long discussion, we decided we'd conceal the chantry as long as we can.
		-To that end, we're going to silence the creature that led us to this place, the flayed one.
			-We tracked her down in her usual hunting ground.
			-La Hiena observed her wandering around it in a regular pattern, standing on corners
			 just outside the circles of illumination from street lights.
			-An hour before dawn, she lifted up the lid of a manhole cover and entered the sewers.
				-Presumably she makes her haven down there.
		-While La Hiena tracked, Maximo hunted.
			-We drained a drunk.
		-Afterwards, we returned to that abandoned house, where Maximo had apparently set up his
		 herd a while back.
	-As we slept, we again shared a nightmare (lost a willpower), like the first night in the
	 chantry.
		-It was quite similar to that first dream, but this time it was our flayed friend we were
		 hunting.
		-Talking amongst ourselves, and doing some degree of interpretation, we got the impression
		 that she is telling us not to betray her, and the ways in which she'd try to distroy us if
		 we do.
			-Sordido even recognized this as a thing from one of the grimoires, recognizing this as
			 demon magic.
				-Some infernalist is fucking with our dreams, inflicting otherworldly experiences on
				 us.
				-To include Sordido, though, they would need to have known his name, perhaps telling
				 us something about our adversary here.
					-He suggests it may be the Tremere.
					-It could also be tied to the infernalist Malkavians we took the journal from.
	-Well, if anything, we're now _more_ interested in confronting that creature.
		-To that end, we continued investigating her.
			-Sordido reached out to his mentors, looking for information.
				-He learned she's was the pack priest for a pack of Serpents of the Light, and
				 likely of the clan herself.
				-They're centered in the Caribbean, but found everywhere the African slave trade
				 was.
				-An offshoot of the Serpents of the Light, they practice Wangaa sorcery.
					-They broke with their parent clan over the fact that it worships an
					 antediluvian.
					-Her pack focused on both Wangaa and Necromancy, and all followed The Path of
					 Power and Inner Voice.
	-After _much_ discussion, we're generally leaning towards spilling the beans to The Sorcerers
	 of Tiocali.
		-They're interests are best aligned with us, and they're already backing us.
			-We want to do everything we can, though, to retain access to the discovered knowledge,
			 and to keep their protection.
				-Especially since we're making an enemy of Carboni.
	-We headed into the city center, to meet with them.
		-Raul Grimaldi met us, and we requested an audience with his masters.
			-I managed to pull Grimaldi aside for a bit and inquire about a box of earth from the
			 town of my birth, which we decided was somewhere in New Mexico.
				-For the Recure of the Homeland ritual.
				-I said I wanted "many handfuls."
				-He told me he would have it within a week, and refused anything when I asked his
				 price, claiming he's "here to serve."
				-A bit concerning, the lack of price, but he _is_ a ghoul apparently in service to
				 The Sorcerers, who we've thoroughly thrown our lot in with.
		-La Viuda Blanca eventually emerged.
			-Maximo opened by verifying our backing from them, their offer of protection.
				-He mentioned the threat by Carboni.
				-She said it still stood.
			-He then informed her we'd found the chantry.
				-She asked for some proof. I offered a demonstration, and performed the Burning
				 Blade ritual.
				-That certainly sufficed. She displayed as obvious a hunger as someone who is
				 basically a skeleton can, and said we must take her to the chantry.
				-She suggested, though, that we travel there carefully, doing so by walking through
				 the land of the dead.
	-La Viuda Blanca performed a gruesome necromantic ritual, jamming a heated needle into each of
	 our eyes by turn.
		-After undergoing the ritual, the world around us looked strange, rotting and decaying.
		-She also stated she was not bound to help Sordido, but suggested that he "stank of the
		 jaguars". She asked if he knew their magics, and he affirmed that he did, satisfying her
		 that he was of use.
			-More evidence Sordido is kin to some cousin of the lupines.
	-With our new sight, she stabbed a bone knife into the pool of blood before her, now black to
	 our eyes.
		-She cut it open, creating some kind of gateway, instructing us to get in, and receive our
		 baptism.
		-Maria boldly stepped in, submerging into the liquid, and emerging on the otherside of a
		 similar pool, surrounded by staring ghosts.
	-She then lead us through the lands of the dead.
		-The ghosts parted at her passage.
		-They resembled the building we had been in, but. . . horrifyingly stylized.
			-The elevator is tangled Victorian wrought iron.
			-The books on shelves have been replaced by the skulls of infants on spikes.
		-As we moved out into the street, we heard shouting and then saw a bunch of Roman-looking
		 centurions march past us (?!?).
		-Concerningly, a storm seemed to be brewing.
			-God knows what that means, in the land of the dead.
			-A blowing wind seemed to push us off towards The Pacific.
			-Black streaks soared through the sky. With a close look, they appear to be _winged_.
	-We made our way all the way back to the chantry.
		-Instead of the farm that exists in our reality, a great ziggurat existed at the location.
		-I told La Viuda that was our destination, but also not a thing that exists on the other
		 side.
			-She nodded, and cut open a new hole in reality for us to step through, back to our
			 reality.
	-We then worked our way through the traps and challenges of the chantry's entrance.
		-While doing so, I elaborated on how we found the place, emphasizing that Tzitzimitl is
		 offering a powerful ritual to us in exchange for the journal that led here.
			-The ritual could be useful, and the whole situation suggests she knew more than she
			 was letting on.
		-Eerily, as soon as she was in the chantry, with our new sight we could see ghosts in her
		 wake, eagerly reading through the ghostly versions of each book she passed.
		-She was fascinated the moment she spotted the dried bloody footprints.
			-The appeared strange in our necromantic sight.
			-I indicated we suspect they're what did in the Sabbat Tremere. . .
		-Now that we were back in the chantry, we were able to speak with Goratrix again, and we
		 took La Viuda down to the basement to make introductions.
			-I explained the ritual to communicate required shared blood, solved by our vaulderie
			 with the Dr.
			-She didn't go in for my gambit suggesting a round of the vaulderie.
				-She suggested there was some barrier to her providing her own blood.
			-Instead, she asked for a bit of Dr. Weber's, offering. . . life force, in exhange.
				-He wisely instead asked to be introduced to Jolan, who he wished to study with.
					-She assented.
			-She then performed the ritual and spoke privately with Goratrix.
	-Afterwards, she spoke with us.
		-Our protection shall indeed be provided for, and the Sorcerers will also provide us
		 further knowledge.
		-In return, we will bring Jolan to Goratrix (apparently they're old colleagues) and help
		 take up Goratrix's war on the Tremere.
			-There are Tremere spies in Mexico city that they can help us find.
		-She also asked that we support the Moderates in an effort to make Jolan the Regent.
		-Finally, she had a plan for dealing with Carboni, but it requires some of his blood.
			-She asked that one of us volunteer for a definitely dangerous gambit. She wants one
			 of us to swear ourself to Carboni, accepting a blood bond, for he knows a way to
			 pervert the vinculum (!).
				-Maximo volunteered.
			-I mentioned the ribbons above that could help us with his Presence powers, which she
			 seemed to have already factored into her plan.
		-She also mentioned eventually engaging in the vaulderie with us, her and the rest of The
		 Sorcerers?
			-A big deal, if so, but lots of questions surround it. Why? On her part, given previous
			 issues raised, how?
	-I again raised the issue of whether we are ready or not to reveal the chantry.
		-Given my. . . commercial interests in the subject.
		-The broad consensus seemed to be to keep it concealed. :(


-Make sure to feed. You're low on blood.
	-Maybe from those held captive at the chantry?
-Lesley posted many more handouts, detailing various figures amongst Sabbat politics.
	-Questions that has raised:
		-What does our pack know about The Harbringers of Skulls?
			-Basically that they've recently appearted and are necromancers.


1/25/21:
	-We spent the day at the chantry, after hunting (d10 reset of blood pool).
	-Dr. Weber got a phone call, and walked out the door.
	-Maximo got his own voice mail.
		-From one Bernarda "Berna" Jimenez.
		-The #character-to-character stuff here: https://discord.com/channels/772879016822046721/788104998331875388/801493387898257468
	-In other words, we're swapping Jason's characters.
	-Maximo, our ductus, put Bernarda to the test, a trial by ordeal via a knife through the hand.
		-Holding silent through the pain, Bernarda was inducted into the pack via the vaulderie.
	-From there, we discussed our next course of action.
		-I felt we should pretty clearly seek out Jolan, bringing her to Goratrix.
		-Through some Sabbat Lore, we identified where she holds court, The Theater Grotesque.
			-Pretty much what you'd expect from a Tzimice theater.
		-We headed there after snacking on a pair of hitchhikers.
	-We attended the theater, and spilled the beans to Jolan.
		-She seemed quite delighted by Goratrix's cruel fate.
		-She clarified what the Sorcerers were offering, loyalty or bargaining as equals.
			-When Bernarda clarified that they wished to support her taking the regency, she
			 accepted that as loyalty.
		-She was indeed willing to come to the chantry and speak with Goratrix, excited to see his
		 fate for herself.
	-She wants to bring all her children with to the chantry, though, so Berna and Xander ran off
	 to the nearest U-Haul equivalent.
		-Going there, they walked right up to a Cainite fight at the rental lot.
		-One of them appeared to be a Thaumaturge, or to have access to one, as he wielded a blade
		 sheathed in green flame.
			-Leon.
		-The other side was a gang of bikers, some Cainites, some mortals, but they were cowed once
		 Leon jammed that flaming blade through what seemed like their leader.
		-Leon wanted to join up with our pack, claiming to be a nomad embraced up North.
		-Xander and Berna grabbed a suitable rental truck, and had Leon drive them back to the
		 theater.
	-We had Xander, Berna, and Leon meet us in a nearby parking lot.
		-Leon didn't seem to be clearly lying, and passed Maximo's loyalty test.
			-He claimed to have gotten his Thaumaturgical knowledge from some Tremere in New York,
			 before the city was lost and he headed South.
		-When I then called to perform the vaulderie, though, he warned us that he was. . .
		 unbondable.
			-_Big_ fucking deal in The Sabbat. Rules out the vaulderie.
			-Sordido objected to it on solid theological grounds, and I agreed.
			-Bernarda, though, raised a reasonable point that he _did_ warn us of this, before
			 participating, giving up a real advantage if his story is true and demonstrating some
			 good faith.
			-That seemed to sway most folks, but I suggested a final test of his story.
				-To rule out an infiltrator with a clever excuse, I suggested he consume a vaulderie
				 in it's entirely, made from the rest of the packs blood. No cost if his story is
				 true, and a protection against treachery if not.
				-He drank it eagerly down, largely satisfying everyone.
	-We then loaded Jolan and company into the truck, driven by Xander and Max, while Leon drove 
	 the minivan with the rest of us.
		-In the city proper, signs of chaos and Cainites were readily evident. Signs of the Sabbat
		 at war with itself are readily evident for those with eyes to see.
		-As thing calmed down more, as we moved outside the city proper, I pressed Leon for more
		 information on how he learned Thaumaturgy.
			-He claimed to have tortured it out of the Tremere.
		-Eventually, Berna and Sordido Had A Bad Feeling About This.
			-There was a flash of light up on a nearby building, and one rear tire of the truck
			 suddenly blew out. Looked like it was shot out.
			-Berna even noticed a nearby cop in a squad car, one that appeared to be signaling
			 something.
			-The truck squealed to a stop, the minivan a bit behind it.
			-From the truck, Jolan began laughing, and in fairly short order the, the vzhod burst
			 through the truck's rollup door.
			-Berna also spotted an Obfuscated assassin, wielding some kind of machine gun, pointing
			 him out to the rest of us and thus breaking the Obfuscation
			-Before anyone else could act, I had him stretched between 5 tentacles emerging from
			 his own shadow, with an arm and both legs broken.
			-The assassin then tried to kill himself.
				-Shouting that we'd never take him alive, he set his arm alight somehow.
				-I simply had the tentacles rip the flaming arm off and throw it aside.
			-My packmates ran over to the cop car, but the figure we thought we saw was gone (or
			 was that the assassin?). There _was_ a very bright laser and a rifle on the dash.
				-La Hiena grabbed the "c-10 canister rifle w shotgun attachment"
					diff 7 rifle, 10 damage, shotgun diff 8, 8L damage
					8 dragons breath rounds for shotgun, secondary magazine of 30 depleted uranium rounds (+2A) for rifle
			-Examining the assassin, we found a tatoo behind his right ear that we knew to mark him
			 as a member of The Black Hand, the Sabbat's special forces.
			-Tasting his blood, and employing Thaumaturgy, I met with substantial success.
				-Our assassin is a 10th generation Assamite, in a vaulderie. He has diablerized
				 _13 fucking times_ in the past four days, last feeding that lats time, on another
				 Assamite. That was _less than an hour ago_.
					-A sign of turmoil in The Hand?
		-As we were cleaning up, Leon remarked that the vzhod is quite the horror.
			-Jolan chimed in, saying it is in fact a work of art! "They'd normally require the
			 magics of the homeland, but I have perfected a method of creating them only with the
			 fleshcrafting gifts of Caine!"
			-Maximo inquired if he could learn such a thing?
				-Jolan informed him that it was far beyond him, but that it was _she_ who had called
				 Dr. Weber away.
				-She had not liked his attitude, though, and so he was being. . . reeducated.
		-La Hiena got the tire changed and we then went on to the chantry.
	-The pack had grown quite suspicious of Leon, and we searched him before entering the chantry,
	 mostly concerned about tracking or communications.
		-Instead, he just had a prodigious quantity of knives and guns secreted about his person.
	-We then led Jolan and the rest down into the chantry to meet with Goratrix.
		-His chamber now held several more of the Sorcerers, as well as a big, skull-lined pit full
		 of blood and viscera in the center.
		-Upon entering the chamber, Jolan announced she had heard the Sorcerers wished to pledge
		 their loyalty to her as Regent.
			-La Viuda agreed, but also said that the new regent must be. . . humble, and know who
			 had put her in power.
			-There was a flash of something decidedly dangerous in Jolan's eyes for a moment, but
			 she nodded, and agreed. A humble regent to rule over humble subjects. . .
		-Jolon also asked Rodolfo, were these not the ones that originally found the late regent?
			-He affirmed it was so, to her seeming delight.
		-La Viuda Blanca proposed that we become, all of us, one big pack (!!!).
			-Rodolfo, a Malkavian, asked if that was wise, as we might all be subject to the
			 properties of his and Eliza's blood.
			-Xander butted in, wisely, to mention that Leon claimed to be unbondable.
			-La Viuda reacted to this by vomitting forth a black cloud, sending Leon into torpor.
			-Examining Leon, she said that there were Tremere magics affecting him in some way,
			 apparently preventing the bond in some fashion.
				-She did not fault us for not spotting it.
				-I mentioned that he had indeed exhibited knowledge of Thaumaturgy, and that I
				 doubted he's to be trusted, but certainly to be watched.
		-Eliza seemed to have heard of Berna.
			-She asked if Berna came representing The Order of St. Blaise, apparently a group
			 within the Sabbat somewhat focused on the humans.
			-Seems like Berna had at least heard of them, and would consider their interests her
			 own.


-We'll have a week of downtime.
	-Maybe spend some XP.
		-You have 14 XP.
		-Likely somewhat limited in what you can learn/advance.
		-Did we workout a learning time for rituals? You _are_ in the chantry, and there are still
		 some decent and easy Thaumaturgy ones available there.
			-Guide to the Sabbat has:
				-Blood Rush (1)
					-Damned useful for just one XP.
				-Machine Blitz (2)
					-Also interesting, but somewhat more situational.
			-Might be wiser to focus on bigger stuff, though.
			-Messaged Lesley about the rituals: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/807738928676339725
				-Sounds like you could do up to two levels worth of rituals, so get just Blood Rush.
			-Ah! Sanguineous Phial is available, so get that!
				http://maierstorm.org/Vampire/index.php?title=Sanguineous_Phial
				-It's in Blood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy	pg. 90-91
		-All 14 could get you Thaumaturgy 3, if you have the time.
			-Eh, it isn't immediately all that useful, and only one or two of the rituals  you
			 can currently get at are all that good at that level.
				-Oh, except for Blazing Shaft!
					-The third level version of Burning Blade, it seems like it would work on _bullets_.
			-Mostly a stepping stone to 4.
			-You want some XP on hand in case you can get to those Abyss Mysticism rituals.
		-4 for Self Control 3?
	-Read more of those Gratiano books?
	-Since she was already running out, I asked Bernarda to pick up a set of stakes for the pack.
		-https://discord.com/channels/772879016822046721/788104998331875388/806683189745680434
		-Got some from the chantry!
	-Get some "white satin ribbon" for Illuminate Trail of Prey!


2/8/21
	-During downtime, my hometown dirt arrived at the house-haven.
	-I also managed to find the other ingredients for my various rituals around the chantry.
	-The Teocali had brain raped Leon during downtime too. 
		-Leon is apparently a Camarilla agent, some kind of assassin, known as a "Alastor" (sp?).
		-The Camrilla seem to have known the location of the chantry, witnessed our pack access it,
		 and were now sending assasins after us.
	-That "Black Hand" agent, meanwhile, is apparently, in fact, a member of the Tal'mahe'Ra, an
	 antediluvian worshipping cult that has infiltrated The Hand.
		-He was working for someone called Izhim ur-Baal, a particularly terrifying Sabbat hero.
			-The assasin believes him to be a member of the Tal'mahe'Ra.
	-The rest of the pack was at the house-haven, so, finding myself half starved by the end of
	 my study time in the chantry, I called Berna asking for a ride to the haven.
		-Xander indeed picked me up, after I had snuck some distance away from the chantry.
		-I brought one of the empty amphoras with me.
	-Back at the house-haven, I took advantage of some takeout the rest of the pack had picked up.
		-I also asked Maximo to have his pack bury the amphora in the backyard for me.
	-With that wrapped up, we headed back to the chantry, to consult with the Teocali, concerning
	 the various assassins that are now after us.
		-I brought about half my hometown dirt to the chantry with us, stashing it in some disused
		 corner of the chantry, writing "Maria's" and a black Sharpie heart on it.
		-When Maximo asked about the Camarilla assassins, Eliza informed us that we must understand
		 how we were being watched, that it was through animals.
			-A power possessed principally by the Nosferatu, Gangrel, and the Tzimice (though that
			 last is not likely involved here).
			-She spoke of an elder, in a cave nearby, El Murciélago, who would know what's going
			 on with animals in the area.
				-"The Bat"
				-Sordido (out for the session) seemed to know something of this elder, saying he is
				 connected to the spirit of the caves in some fashion.
				-Eliza said he's a loyalist.
			-Jolan also suggested that the Lasombra Lilian Monroe might also be able to help.
				-She has declared herself Prisci, though it's not widely known, in recognition
				 of her help in taking Los Angeles.
				-Jolan had sent for her, though, and she is now in Mexico City.
					-Jolan wishes her to join our cause, but they have some disagreement.
						-Jolan said she claimed to "know how to act", but that it was _Jolan_
						 who truely knows, and she tried to. . . teach Lilian.
					-Jolan actually means for _her_ to be regent (despite her garbage acting).
						-She think Lilian to be the leader the Sabbat truely needs.
					-Jolan told us she is in the Polanco Colonia, more or less the Beverly Hills
					 of Mexico city, in the Miguel Hidalgo borough of Mexico City.
	-We left to pursue this Gangrel elder.
		-La Hiena seems to have quite the arsenal, all of which he straps to himself and brings
		 with.
		-On our way out of the chantry, though, Eliza followed us, expressing an interest in joining
		 us for this.
			-We had not yet been joined in the vinculum, though, and I reminded the pack that Rodolfo
			 had concerns about the rest of us consuming his and Eliza's Malkavian blood.
			-Maximo opted to ask her to remain behind instead.
				-He had first suggested that vaulderie, prompting my reminder above.
		-Sordido instructed us to find an island made of stacked stones, in the midst of a swampy
		 lake in a national park.
		-There's a substantial tourism industry, though, with party boats plying the water.
		-Bernarda and Maximo went off to hire a boat for us (I waited in the car).
			-They talked a pair of stoners into it, Berna explaining Xander and I as cosplay.
			-The stoner-boatmen knew of the island in question.
			-As we drew closer to it, it got creepy, and the wildlife got _intense_.
				-Giant bats everywhere, using a stick to keep snakes of the boat, etc.
			-The stoner brought us around to the side of the island that featured a large crack,
			 the cave in question.
			-Upon arrival, Bernarda simply called for the elder by name, and he emerged from the
			 cave a short while later.
			-Though uninterested in the two stoners' tainted blood (Maximo then promptly killed
			 them), he was quite helpful when I announced our intent, to ask his aid in tracking
			 down the Camarilla pawns that had invaded Mexico city, spying on us through animals.
				-He claimed the Camarilla's Nosferatu had moved into Mexico City, and were
				 responsible, but also that we must instead strike at the root of the problem.
				-He said that the Nosferatu were being shielded by "garou".
					-Asking for clarification, he explained they were lupines, the werewolves.
					-He claimed they were providing some kind of ward, to hide and defend the
					 Nosferatu.
					-He said the beasts were operating from an alley somewhere in the city.
						-Pressed on _which_ alley, he explained he'd received word of them from
						 bats and, well, they're bats.
						-He did say they had witnessed many of the beasts entering a pile of
						 cardboard, far more than could actually fit.
				-He also questioned us, apparently aware we were seen leading Jolan into the desert.
					-I volunteered that we had meant to support Jolan's bid for Regent.
					-El Murciélago seemed to think that was an awful idea, and I reassured him that
					 Jolan seemed to agree.
					-Who, then, he asked, did we mean to support for Regent?
					-I got cagey, saying Jolan had spoken well of others, but we did not yet know.
	-Taking our leave of El Murciélago, it seems we must hunt lupines.
		-We racked our brains for options to find them.
			-Maximo's text to his contact in the police bore fruit.
			-He was aware of sightings of some kind of "trash wizard", as the homeless nearby had
			 deemed him. Someone pursued a couple of times for public drinking, he'd been followed
			 to a cardboard box where he was said to live, but no one was ever found there when it
			 was checked.
			-The box has been sighted in different locations, all though in the Miguel Hidalgo area.
				-That's the territory of Archbishop Adonai, a Salubri antitribu.
				-Two packs also call the area home.
					-One is a group of newly trained Salubri antitribu.
					-The other are six Ventrue antitribu, watching the Salubri.
						-Old school, they carry longswords and shields into battle.
		-With some idea of where to look, we also went to arm ourselves.
			-Xander knew of an armorer apparently, and is texting him, looking into silver bullets.
			-Berna had her own errand to run, though it is less clear what it was.
				-Eh, she spends overly much time with the kine. It's likely more of the same.
			-Meanwhile, we stopped by a Walmart.
				-Berna and Max picked up a pile of machetes and a gardening scythe from the gardening
				 shop.
				-Xander picked up a trio of people of Walmart, from the parking lot.
			-Back at the haven, I performed my own ritual preparations.
				-3 successes on Heart of Silence, so it will last 3 nights, starting 2/8
				-7 successes on the now-burning scythe, which Max claimed.
				-Machete successes: 1 2 2 4 5
				-New moon will be on the 11th, at which point the blades will lose their flames.
	-Twenty minutes from sunrise, we recieved a text from Eliza.
		-Apparently someone attempted to astrally visit the chantry. They even reached the elders
		 in the heart of it, and tried to make contact with them, but were driven off.
		-Bizarrely, they seemed to be travelling astrally _in a yellow submarine_?!?
		-Eliza is also apparently now trapped outside the chantry, unable to get back in.
		-Most likely, it's the expected ravings of a Malkavian, but it's likely a good idea to
		 address it tomorrow night either way.
			-Can't have her causing a scene outside the chantry, is she is indeed trapped on the
			 other side of the challenges, trying to escapes someone's Beatles CD or some such.
	-That day, we again dreamed.
		-We were in the chantry, looking out through a fishbowl, indeed looking at a yellow submarine
		 floating above us.
		-Well, Eliza isn't _completely_ crazy, I guess.


2/22/21:
	-We woke the next evening, with Sordido at the chantry, Berna who knows where, and the rest of
	 us at the house.
	-I snacked on our remaining person of Walmart (took 6, leaving her there), and we then headed
	 out the door.
		-As we left the house, a sports car squealed to a stop out front, with Berna in the
		 passenger seat.
		-She's claiming the driver, an old stoner and apparently wealthy, is under her protection.
			-He _did_ toss the keys to the car to Maximo when Max complemented him on it, saying
			 Max could have it.
			-Apparently he's Carlos Slim (lol).
	-We returned to the chantry, leaving Berna and Xander with Carlos some distance away.
		-We met Eliza outside of it, and let her in.
		-We also discussed the submarine with her.
			-She last saw it near morning, before our dream.
			-She saw it penetrate each of the chantries wards, by shooting little torpedos and 
			 passing through the resulting crack before it healed.
		-We then went deeper into the chantry and found the rest of the sorcerers.
			-Rodolfo and Eliza agreed it sounded like something their clan would come up with, this
			 yellow submarine business, but Rodolfo said he didn't feel the madness of their clan
			 upon it.
			-Goratrix believes that these people are watching us from some place else, some other
			 realm, but he believes he knows how to access such a place.
				-He believes this to be the work of mortal wizards, though not the Order of Hermes
				 he once knew.
				-He mentioned a node, at the heart of the chantry, offering arcane power, but also
				 suggested it was somehow unusable to the magi. Instead, he suggested their eyes
				 were likely on us, instead, this representing the heart of the magic of the
				 Sabbat.
				-He proposed awakening the spirit associated with the chantry's node.
					-Tlaloc (sp?), who knows itself as a god of rain, and who stretches all through
					 the watered lands of Mexico.
					-It had some relation to the old vampire lords of indigenous Mexico, allowing
					 them to hold dominion over the kine of the land.
					-House Goratrix had collected several pieces of the sleeping being, but not all
					 of them.
					-Only Jolan believed that was wise, though.
						-"This spirit sounds like quite the actor! We should see what role a god
						 plays!"
					-The others think it less than wise, though Esteban seems half tempted.
					-He asked what we thought, to which Maximo volunteered that we _need_ power.
						-At that moment, though, he had some vision, of Goratrix reaching for him
						 from the mirror, surrounded by tantacles.
						-Maximo then freaked out a bit, brandishing his scythe, while Goratrix
						 claimed to not know what he was talking about.
							-We saw at least one similar vision, in a dream when we slept in the
							 chantry.
	-Shit, the astral submarine is back, having emerged from the pool of blood at the center of the
	 chantry's basement.
		-It circled the room a bit, visible to those with Auspex, then rose up through the ceiling.
	-Still weirder, we now hear radio static, then dolphin noises, through the mouths of the statues
	 around the ritual pool.
		-Then, "This is Hagbard Celine, of the Lief Ericson. This is an SOS. Please reply."
		-No answer, though, to verbal responses.
	-I then attempted Illuminate Trail of Prey, and was indeed able to follow the trail of the
	 submarine, all the way up through the entry maze and to the surface, finding an empty car
	 (no Berna, Xander, or Carlos) and a visible-only-to-Sordido yellow submarine, floating two
	 feet off the ground at the end of the trail.
		-Suddenly, glitter explosion, and we're aboard an enterprise bridge talking to a dolphin in
		 a wheeled fish tank.
		-A voice from a nearby speaker recommended we stick fishes in our ears, turning dolphin noises
		 to intelligble speech.
			-His name is Howard, and he offered to take us to our fellows, who were on their way to 
			 meet Hagbard Celine.
	-Reaching the bridge, it's basically a late 60's disco with a captain's wheel in the center.
		-The view from the window seems all kind of weird, with spirits clearly visible, among other
		 strange emanations.
		-We made our introductions and Xander tried the fake-blood sorbet.
		-Carlos seemed to be acquainted with these folks.
			-Some hints Carlos is somehow disguised? Hagbard also referred to him as "Muldune" (sp?)
		-Hagbard asked us if we had heard of Camilla Baines, with at least a few of the pack associating
		 her with the Countess Bathory legend, of bathing in virgin blood for immortality.
		-Seems their trouble began when they captured this woman.
			-Hagbard was under the impression she's a founding member of the Illuminati, though he
			 might be beginning to doubt that.
			-Howard wheeled her in, staked and desicated.
				-They found her in "an Illuminati stronghold", stuffed in a gun case.
		-Xander unwisely suggested we celebrate something, and a magic party began.
		-Apparently, they believe that, at some point in the future, they will be attacked by a
		 vampire, and can only be protected by another.
			-That, they claim, is why they sought us out, at the chantry that glows brightly to
			 their arcane sight.
			-Unfortunately, they want their protection to stay close to them, and we have other urgent
			 goals to attend to.
			-Though, I pointed out that they _do_ seem able to travel unseen and intangibly. Perhaps
			 they could be of assistance to us in our werewolf hunt, and able to stay close to us
			 during it.
			-Hagbard proceeded to consult his computer, "Fuckup".
				-In addition to cryptic utterances, we were shown images of cardboard boxes, in
				 San Francisco, Vancouver, Florida, and several in Mexico, all linked by string.
				-Hagbard was none to sure we'd be able to simply walk into one of these boxes, though.
					-Digging further with Fuckup, we got an image of motorcycle boots, with a
					 a strange symbol on them: https://discord.com/channels/772879016822046721/772879017257992192/813607068812181540
						-It reminded me of old, primal magic, but nothing specific.
		-Xander got chipped by a dolphin.
			-Well, at least, he ate a magic Dorito, that dissolved and then aggressively slid down
			 his throat. Now, Hagbard seems to be able to broadcast his voice from Xander's mouth,
			 albeit while sounding like an old PA system.


-Between sessions, I proposed tasting the blood of that husk, with the first level of Thaumaturgy: https://discord.com/channels/772879016822046721/772879017257992192/813974970480197693
	-Maximo is on board and that "excellent idea" from Lesley _might_ have been in character as
	 Hagbard, so go ahead with this the next session.D


3/8/21: We debate diablerie
	-I tasted the husk:
		-6th gen Malkavian
		-2 vitae remaining
		-3084 years old
	-We're under the impression she's a founder of the Camarilla, from what pieces of lore various
	 packmates recalled.
	-We debated diablerizing her, perhaps with The Ritual of the Bitter Rose, or delivering her to
	 The Sorcerers and Such.
		-In the end, though, he opted to delay, when Captain Hagbard offered a vault in which to
		 delay such decisions, which turned out to be the engine room.
		-Maria's hand was stayed in part by someone remembering that ritual had been offered, and
		 in part for fear of the creature that this turned out ot be.
	-We then ran back down into the chantry, running the idea of negotiating some trade with
	 Tzitzimitl by the others
		-She had offered us The Ritual of the Bitter Rose to us in exchange for the book that led
		 to the chantry.
		-They said they'd trust in our judgement, though they'd hold us to account.
	-Over seeking the lupines, we then sought out Tzitzimitl, to offer her alliance in exchange for
	 her knowledge.
		-She was willing, but requested protection from the Inquisition.
		-For, she was not truely a Serpent, but Baali. Uh oh.
		-She claimed, though, that I could learn the ritual this very night. Through, however,
		 dealing with a demon.
			-At the cost of an unspecified body part, I could somehow learn it tonight.
		-Maria was pretty adamently against making this deal (herself, at least).
			-It seemed to be open to the others too, though at a higher cost since they didn't
			 have prior Thaumaturgy knowledge.
			-Sordido did seem tempted, but ultimately didn't want to pay a higher price, still
			 measured in flesh.
			-Maximo, though. . .
	-Berna Star Treked in, to try and talk Max out of it, but to no avail.
		-Berna then insisted she'd have no part of this, and began to walk off.
		-Sordido recommended killing her, a suggestion Maximo ran with (and ran after her, with
		 Celerity).
		-Berna, though, managed to entrance him with Presence, for a year and a day. . .
			-Sounds like Jake may be out, as a result, though we'll see in between sessions.
				-He might make a new character, but also sounds like he wasn't too into the style
				 of the game.
				-Sordido ducked out for the night as well, though the rest of us continued on.
	-Lesley-controlled Maximo and Sordido were still quite intent on demon bargaining, while Berna
	 was adamently against it.
		-She's got Maximo entranced, but he's burning through his remaining Willpower quite quickly
		 as he bucks it, to intermittently demand the demon-power and hit her.
		-Wait, what about Xander?
			-Weeellll. . . Berna admitted to sending him on an "errand". Pressed a bit further, it
			 was to kill Tzitzimitl.
			-Uh oh.
	-Maximo, his willpower worn down at least somewhat, and Berna began walking off in search of
	 Xander, while I tried to get a moment alone with Sordido.
		-He volunteered that he was going to undergo Tzitzimitl's ritual, but I had actually wanted
		 to ask his thoughts on our pack's new power structure.
		-That caught Berna's Auspex-enhanced ear, though, and she began another (not entirely
		 incorrect) lecture on the dangers of demons, heavy on loyalty to The Sabbat.
	-Maximo has managed to still remain very insistent on the ritual going forward, with Sordido
	 the subject.
		-He demanded that I watch Sordido, and kill him if he's somehow corrupted as a result.
		-I assented, and they wandered off for a snack (and maybe to help Xander).
			-I put in a takeout request, lol.
	-When we approached Tzitzimitl, she produced a staked Xander, saying he had made an attempt on
	 her life. She still seemed willing to perform the ritual, though, wishing to use Xander's blood.
		-I named Xander impetuous, but also said that Maximo and I would sorely miss him. Keep him
		 alive.
	-Sordido underwent a ritual heavy on lightening and burning skin brands.
		-Tlaloc came up, suggesting she's tied to it's cult
		-He now manages to be uglier if anything, but does have some cool lightening bolt brands
		 and such.
		-His first words on the other side of it, though, were, "You harmed my pack."
	-Shit was on.
		-Maximo ran at Tzitzimitl while I summoned tentacles from the shadows of Xander's clothes.
		-Tzitzimitl knocked Max to the ground with a single blow while a tentacle pulled out
		 Xander's stake.
		-Xander predictably frenzied once up, and lept onto Tzitzimitl.
		-I then turned the tentacles on Tzitzimitl, and quickly incapacitated her with a broken
		 neck.
		-Xander eagerly drank from her, but Sordido reminded us of the ritual we'd come to acquire,
		 and I turned some tentacles to holding Xander back.
		-Xander calmed down and Sordido performed the ritual.
			-As a result, I went down _2_ generations to 8!!!
				-All the rest went from 13 to 10, save Sordido who went 10 to 8 as well.
					-Oh, apparently Berna didn't participate (as learned in the review the next
					 session).
				-Apparently Tzitzimitl was 6th gen (and apparently this ritual is even better than
				 I thought).
			-Lesley warned that this was not necessarily the guaranteed result, Sordido having
			 rolled well. It could have benefitted only some of us.


-Lesley said no real down time before next session.
-You _really_ want to feed before turning in for the day.
	-Maria would hate to give up the blood of her love.


4/5/21: Back to it!
	-Sordido and Maximo have both dropped from the game.
		-Both characters are with us, though, for the moment, at least.
	-We headed back to the van, where Berna was already on a phone call.
	-After we piled in, though, a pickup squealed up next to us with someone brandishing an RPG at
	 us from the back, firing before anyone could react.
		-The minivan probably isn't going anywhere ever again, though their truck looks a bit
		 scorched too, from the close range.
		-Still, they were able to speed off as we bailed out of the now burning van.
		-Xander managed to leap into the truck bed.
			-The vampire back there thankfully stumbled while trying to kick Xander out of the
			 weaving truck, while Xander miraculously managed to keep his footing at all.
		-Xander nearly managed to unload a round of dragon's breath into the RPG guy's chest, but
		 RPG dude did something terrifying, something distinctly unnatural feeling, to act
		 incredibly quick and shove the shotgun barrel aside, his eyes filled with blood.
		-A moment later (Celerity!), Xander did manage to do the job, though, tearing the guy's
		 chest up with the rifle in his other arm.
		-A burst from the rifle through the back window, though, missed the driver, who lept from
		 the vehicle.
			-The truck crashed into something and exploded.
		-Xander lept too, onto the driver. He dashed a bit away, though, when the driver dropped
		 something sufficiently grenade like to be alarming.
			-Ah, it might have been a detonator, explaining the truck's explosion, and likely
			 covering the more metaphorical tracks from his drive-by.
		-The driver began firing at Xander, shouting, "That damned Toreador is going to get me
		 killed!"
			-Carboni?
			-Shit, he said _Berna_ had them do this?!?
		-They rolled in the dirt, grappling and firing at one another


-Just like last time, you _really_ want to feed before turning in for the day.
	-Maria would hate to give up the blood of her love.


TODO:
	-Stuff that changes with your now lowered generation:
		-Rushing to Darksteel may be wise.
			15	Potence 2 & 3
			18	Learning the power (but from _whom_?)
			---
			33
		-Path of the Focused Mind is also now great.
			-Yeah, get the first dot ASAP. It's 7 XP (not _cheap_, but hardly a ton) and makes you
			 _quicker_, which is an important complement to your existing high lethality.
			-I _think_ this is how the first power works: https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/4vdtw8/vtm_thaumaturgy_focused_mind_readiness/
			-Oh, and to it's trade value, "Developed by a Tremere Kabbalah scholar"!
				-Zadkiel is into that Kabbalah shit.
		-Shit, Black Metamorphosis is now fast.
	-Look at any newly available rituals.
		-Additionally available rituals: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/808202333846372402
			-Was previously told contents of Low Clans and Guide to the Sabbat should be available.
				-Of the first three levels, Wielding the Spear of Damnation looked _particularly_ good.
					-It's a V20 one. Here's the text: http://forum.theonyxpath.com/forum/main-category/main-forum/the-classic-world-of-darkness/vampire-the-masquerade/1208512-wielding-the-spear-of-damnation
		-Stake-related ones: https://discord.com/channels/772879016822046721/788104998331875388/808194069649162262
			-All three are interesting, with Awakening the Verdant Thorn probably being most
			 immediately interesting to you (unless someone knows Archery for the Shaft!).
	-Look at V20 Abyss Mysticism rituals!
		-Lesley OKed their use.
		-That allows the feed-through-tentacles one, Feed the Darkness!
			-Pg. 38 of Rites of the Blood.
			-System is kind of vague on how the feeding actually works.
			-Ritual seems to be cost free, though!
			-6 XP to learn, 3 x it's level of 2.
		-Seems like the only especially good one in Rites of Blood
		-All of them in Lore of the Clans are slightly tweaked reprints of High Clanes ones.
		-V20 Tome of Secrets has an interesting one, "The third eye of Rickard Argentis"
			-Easiest to Google, it's a 3rd level which summons an arm for you the next time you're
			 surprised.
		-Might be more interesting stuff in the new V20 Black Hand book, which has the Oubliette
		 stuff.
	-Get Fortitude and Potence, as fast as possible!
		-Fortitude is probably higher priority, but both are great.
		-Jake has Potence.
		-No one has Fortitude, sadly.
		-It also won't prevent the damage from your summoning rituals either.
	-Should you learn the Monmancy rite?
		-I don't think we want this happening between pack members, but the option to sanction them
		 with NPCs offers some interesting possibilities.
		-A rank of rites would also offer _many_ more, since it's non-linear.
			-Eh, sounds like, after character creation, we're just going to roleplay each one
			 acquired.
	-Presence?
		-Maximo or Berna can teach it.
		-Holy shit, would Presence work on Abyss creatures?
			-If so, Maria is suddenly _really_ into it.
			-The limits her freakiness imposes on her with kine would be no issue. A benefit, if
			 anything.
			-Ehhhh, the only ones you can _summon_ anytime soon would already be bound to you.
	-Dominate?
		-Cheap, it being a Clan Discipline, and many combos with Obtenebration.
			-D5/O5 body invasion is particularly amazing.
		-Your stats are well suited to it too.
		-Lesley suggested a good reason Maria might find the subject interesting, Clan Lasombra
		 viewing it as _controlling people's inner darkness_. . .
	-Teach pack members Obtenebration!
	-Help pack members onto Paths, ideally Path of Night.
	-Get blood!
		-Hunt?
			-Dating profiles? Helps with some of your flaws, while taking advantage of your social
			 skills.
		-Cult?
		-Extort from party members?
			-_Their_ blood?!?
	-Find a haven for the pack? Improve it?
		-And then get that ritual setup together!
		-Got that covered. Now figure out the ritual room.
			-Sounds like it is indeed just obsidian panelling, sealing the room from light, an obsidian
			 knife, and a stone bowl.
			-Now that you've got money, via whatever Berna and Muldune/Carlos setup, this is fairly
			 easy.
				-Doing it at both house and chantry may be desirable.
		-Abyssal guardians?
	-Learn more about The Abyss!
		-That night sight ritual is a great first candidate.
		-Start sucking up to the Sachiriel
			-And figure out the terms of this deal where you're settling a debt for them.
			-Are you owed a boon you can cash in for this?
	-Archbishop Pulanco is the anachronism I need to talk to about Armory of the Abyss.
		-He hunts lupines in it.
		-He's in Mexico.
	-Figure out something about that shipment the "Regent" and crew had been talking about?
		-Might be an option for blackmailing our way free of Veneri Carboni.
	-Write Vaulderie rants! Also, generally step up your religious ranting.
		-One Lesley offered:
			Join us, brothers and sisters. Join us in the shadows where we stand vigilant. Join us as we carry the duty that can not be forsworn. And should you perish, know that your sacrifice will not be forgotten. And that one day we shall join you.
		-Lesley also suggested this actual-Satanist text as reflective of the Lasombra outlook: https://www.scribd.com/document/328330518/lhp-naa-218-liber-falxifer-vol-ii-pdf
			-The language is definitely very evocative, and good inspiration for how Maria should talk.
