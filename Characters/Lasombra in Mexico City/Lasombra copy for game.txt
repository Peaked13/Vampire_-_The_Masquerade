Merits & Flaws:
	Harbinger of the Abyss (5-pt. Flaw)
		You are a conduit to the ultimate darkness
		that lies Beyond. Lights dim in your presence and
		shadows rustle at the edge of vision in dire anticipation
		of your blasphemy. Small fires extinguish
		when you draw close and the chill of the Void is in
		your touch. Your player must roll your
		Obtenebration rating against the soak difficulty of
		any mundane flame within two yards of you. This
		roll is reflexive and mandatory, and success extinguishes
		the flame. This dimming is in addition to
		suffering the effects of Touch of Frost and Eerie
		Presence (Dark Ages: Vampire pp. 308–9). The
		Flaw conveys one benefit: Your unnatural radiance reduces
		the difficulty of all Intimidation rolls
		by 3, to a minimum difficulty of 4. Characters
		must have at least one dot of Obtenebration to
		purchase this Flaw
			Effectively includes Touch of Frost (Core pg. 301) and Eerie Presence (Core pg. 302)
	Animate Shadow (3-pt. Flaw)
		Your shadow has a bizarre unlife of its own,
		reaching out with claws to grasp the shadows of
		those around you in a parody of feeding or billowing
		to a demonic mien when frenzy threatens to
		overtake you. Some Lasombra believe this curse
		afflicts only those who delve too deeply into the
		mysticism of the Abyss; others attribute it to infernal
		pacts, the wrath of God or a shameful lack of
		self-control. Regardless, you lose two dice from all
		Social rolls with other Lasombra who know of your
		problem. This Flaw occasionally manifests among
		vampires who do not belong to the Clan of Shadows,
		but such accursed individuals invariably
		disappear under mysterious circumstances, perhaps
		swallowed by their own alien darkness.
	Death’s Reflection (3-pt. Supernatural Flaw)
		You cast a reflection normally, which would cancel
		out the clan weakness — except that your reflection
		always shows the state you’d be in if you were dead.
		Any Lasombra more than a few decades old looks in
		reflection like an ambling skeleton. Younger vampires
		appear as rotting corpses

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-A slight latina girl in life, your appearance now readily betrays your flirtation with The
		 Abyss. Your skin has darkened to nearly the same jet black as your hair (Blood of Ahriman
		 ritual). Your touch is colder than even a Kindred has right to be and mortals tremble in
		 your presence (your flaws).
	-As a mortal:
		-Probably not the greatest childhood.
		-You were a mean girl.
			-You delighted in belittling and tormenting others.
				-You were about as hard on yourself.
			-Really, you feared abandonment and that others would inevitably let you down. If they
			 (and you) saw them as pathetic, maybe they wouldn't go. Inevitably, this ensured that
			 they did.
			-Nonetheless, you always managed to drag new "friends" into your circle, for a time, at
			 least.
		-You spoke Spanish at home, but mostly English otherwise.
	-Your embrace:
		-At age 19, you were part of a Sabbat mass embrace.
		-The last memory you have of your mortal life is darkness.
			-Your sire surrounded you in a Shroud of Night, drained you, and dragged you off to
			 perform the embrace.
			-In that darkness, you first felt peace, even if it was the peace that causes a rabbit
			 to go limp in a wolf's jaws.
	-After the embrace, you and twelve others were turned loose as part of a Sabbat siege.
		-By the time other vampires of the Sabbat came to collect the survivors, just before
		 dawn, you were the only one that remained, hiding in an alley and shrouded in wisps of
		 darkness.
			-Several died protecting you, while the last died distracting a Camarilla vampire
			 that was pursuing you. You told him the way you'd come was clear, then ran the
			 opposite direction.
	-You sire mfound you after the seige and you were adopted into his pack, all Lasombra.
		-Your sire, Zadkiel Ben Aron, stood out a bit from the others of the pack.
			-He was older than the rest of the pack, and a master of Obtenebration.
			-He'd witnessed a bit of your manipulation of the others you were embraced with, and
			 was the one who found you in the alley, swathed in shadows.
		-As they tutored you in Obtenebration, the darkness you loved even before your first
		 drop of blood, you dived deep into the abyssal secrets your sire could share.
		-From him, you not only grew powerful in Obtenebration, you also learned the secrets
		 and rituals of Abyss Mysticism as well. Soon, you too were following his footsteps on
		 The Path of Night.
		-The pack as a whole, though, slowly grew more dysfunctional during your time with them.
			-More cruel, too.
			-Eventually, as the tenants of the Path of Night were revealed to you, you recognized
			 your tutor's hand in this.
			-He would set them against each other, formenting needless conflicts.
			-When you confronted him about it, he used it as an excuse to lecture about the path,
			 saying his evil influence would only strengthen the best of the pack, breaking only
			 what was weak.
				-"Ahriman consumes, but the weak fall first into his maw."
		-One by one, they fell in the campaign against the Camarilla that you had been embraced
		 for.
			-
		-THIS NO LONGER APPLIES:
			-Then, when you awoke one evening, your tutor was gone. None of the other pack members
			 could (or would) tell you where he had gone.
			-You strongly suspect they killed him or drove him off.
			-As far as you're concerned, that suspicion was confirmed when, a short while after he
			 disappeard, they moved to get rid of you.
				-They left you with a newly formed pack of similarly young Sabbat.
				-They said the pack was moving to take part in a dangerous crusade, and that there
				 you'd find a mission more suited to your talents.
				-You believe they wanted to get rid of the last of your tutor's influence.
	-You love The Abyss.
		-What fault can you possibly find in *nothing*? And, you know it wants you, with a. . .
		 hunger that no one else ever has. You felt it that very first night of your new life.

Equipment:
	-Pack of cheap folding knives, unused.
		-Drinking the Blood of Ahriman requires "a knife that has never tasted blood."
	-A black handled folding straight razor, used only for The Vaulderie.
	-A pack of tea light candles and a pair of cigarette lighters.
		-Shadow of Hands that Serve and Heart That Beats in Silence both require crushing a lit
		 candle.
	-Clothing:
		-Maria wears a T-shirt, jeans, and a thigh-length hooded jacket.
		-She's got a pair of gloves in one pocket of the jacket and dark sunglasses in another.
			-She occasionally find it prudent to hide her strange coloration as much as possible.

Advancement:
	-Disciplines:
		-Fortitude would be the most important discipline to acquire.
			-Beyond protecting you, your Arms even benefit from it.
			-Sweet combo too: Armor of Darkness (Dark Ages Companion, page 87, column 2), Obtenebration 4, Fortitude 2
				-Distinct from Armory of the Abyss, below, it's about soaking fire and sun
			-Fortitude also protects your from the point of aggravated damage from your summoning
			 rituals, taking them from expensive to cheap or free.
				-_Free_ makes them terrifying.
		-Potence, a clan discipline, isn't very good for you _immediately_, since it doesn't read
		 like it applies to the tentacles (*maybe* to attack with attached to you lvl 4 tentacles).
			-It allows an *amazing* combo, Dark Steel, though, for Obtenebration 3 and Potence 3.
				-Libellus Sanguinus 1, page 33
				-Another point of Generation would be necessary to pay its cost in one turn, though.
			-Armory of the Abyss lets you make weapons from shadows with the same requirements, and
			 armor too, with Fortitude 3.
				-The way the rules are written, there's sharp XP incentive to only get it once you
				 have both Fortitude and Potence at 3, though you could maybe ask about that.
			-In the meantime, it also buffs you in regular close combat, which is no small benefit,
			 especially if you've got Drinking the Blood of Ahriman up.
		-Celerity would be decent too.
		-Dominate also has potential.
			-It's a clan discipline and the checks requires are well suited to your attributes and
			 abilities.
		-Obfuscate has some mild potential too.
		-Koldunic Sorcery would also be an option
			-The Ways of Fire and Sorrow both benefit from your high manipulation
				-The former isn't too thematic, given your love of _darkness_, but the latter very much is.
			-The easy rituals that recover willpower are so good that, if power gaming, essentially 
			 _everyone_ should take a dot
			-If you're going to use one of the Ways (maybe not, if you just want the level 1 rituals),
			 you'll want The Way of the Spirit too.
			-It unfortunately uses it's own Knowledge, Koldunism, rather than Occult
		-Otherwise, as generation permits it, advancing Obtenebration is probably the most beneficial
		 thing you can do.
	-You're extremely interested in any Abyss Mysticism rituals you can possibly learn about.
		-Both for roleplay and power reasons.
		-Clanbook Lasombra has two weird alternate uses of powers (Ob 3 and 6), and a few other weird
		 options (blood point to taste/smell with tentacles. . .). They don't seem to require any XP
		 or ritual learning, as written.
		-V20 has more if you want to dip into that, in Rites of the Blood at least
			-Including one where you can feed with your tentacles.
	-Until then, and until you can learn new disciplines, Brawl and Dodge are decent abilities to increase.
	-In an especially stable and immobile pack, you might consider the Herd background, to solve
	 that high blood expenditure.
	-Your real advancement likely only comes with diablerie.
		-You burn blood like crazy, and need the expanded pool.
		-That's the only way you'll ever further increase your Obtenebration too.
	-Tentative schedule:
