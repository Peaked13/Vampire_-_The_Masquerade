-Thin blood alchemist:
	-Some of that drug / anarchist cook feel.
		-Maybe more mercenary / blackmarketeer feeling?
	-Definitely a good fit in an Anarch game.
	-Circulatory System Loresheet (Core pg. 386) sounds very interesting.
	-For your Thin-Blood Merits and Flaws, Thin-blood Alchemy and Discipline Affinity (Presence
 	 balanced by Bestial Temper and Clan Curse Brujah?
		-Making you a kind of psuedo-Brujah.
		-Maybe some other Flaw to get Day Drinker? Baby Teeth would be suitable.
	-Backgrounds:
		-Definitely has Contacts.
		-Haven with the 1 dot Creepy _haven_ Flaw?
		-Herd dots now have Resonance options that would be _very_ useful to a Thin-blood.
		-Mask, and maybe it's Cobbler add on could suit blackmarket / drugs.
		-Resources of course.
-Nosferatu sandman:
	-Good predator type and stereotypical Nosferatu is as good in V5 as anywhere else.
	-Zelios Loresheet, with a focus on havens, is good, interesting, and Nosferatu specific.
-Bahari Tremere:
	-Siren predator type, obviously.
	-House Carna dovetails well with Bahari beliefs, and both offer interesting loresheets.
	-Stalker Background Flaw (under Retainers) would suit this well.
