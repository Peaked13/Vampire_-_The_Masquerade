Merits & Flaws: (-8 Freebie Points)
	Accute Sense (1 pt. Merit, Core pg. 296):
		-Accute hearing reduces all related difficulties by two.
	Bad Sight (1 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 297): ?
		-Can wear glasses for it, or it would be more points. Without them, +2 difficulty for
		 anything involving sight.
	Bound  (2 pt. Flaw, Guide to the Camarilla pg. 77):
		-To $OTHER_MALKAVIAN.
	Concentration (1 pt. Merit, Core pg. 298):
		-You're unaffected by penalties from distracting circumstances.
	Deep Sleeper (1 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 299):
		-Difficulty of any die roll to wake during the day is +2.
	Efficient Digestion (3 pt. Merit, Core pg. 297):
		-You draw more than the usual nourishment from blood, gaining an extra point in your blood
		 pool for every two points of blood you consume.
	Oracular Ability (3 pt. Merit, Core pg. 300):
		-Storyteller can call for Perception + Occult to see an omen, followed by Intelligence +
		 Occult to interpret it.
	Old Pal  (2 pt. Merit, Guide to the Camarilla pg. 75):
		-Provides you "a very loyal Ally", $OTHER_MALKAVIAN.
		-Hmm. . . maybe Allies are supposed to be human. . .
	Phobia (2 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 299):
		-You're afraid of snakes, and need to make a Courage roll or retreat from them.
	True Love (4 pt. Merit, Core pg. 301):
		-You truely love $OTHER_MALKAVIAN, and now _always_ will. One auto success on Willpower rolls.
		-(Description says the other party is mortal, but there's nothing that suggests that _has_
		 to be so for this to work. Worst case, you have more points to spend.)

Freebie Points: 7 (15 - 8 for Merits and Flaws)
	7	Auspex 2

Derangements:
	Manic-Depression (Core pg. 223):
		-Depressions can be triggered by secret Willpower (difficulty 8) rolls after failures, or
		 automatically after botches or when blood pool drops below 2.
		-In a depressive state, Willpower is halved and may not spend blood for Attributes.
		-After, difficult of frenzy rolls is one higher for a proportionate amount of time.

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-As a mortal:
		-
	-Your embrace:
		-
	-Either of these paired characters could plausibly be played, or _both_ by different players.
	-A core part of the concept is both possessing the Efficient Digestion Merit.
		-As the Merit's vague rules have it, two vampires willing to feed from one another can
		 have infinite blood.
		-The obvious issue with that is the blood bond, a problem transcended here through The
		 Power of Love. The bond only reinforces a devotion the lovers felt even in life.
		-Also obvious, this is all a bit dubious, rules and flavor-wise both.
			-A Storyteller should of course feel free to forbid it on either score.
			-Limiting it's impact, though, is, again, the bond, and also the madness of the lovers.
			-Further, part of the story _is_ that something dangerously interesting is going on here.
				-The lovers _know_ what they have is special. Unfortunately, others might well agree,
				 potentially placing them in grave danger.
		-Their Retainers are one of the ends they put this miracle too, easily feeding ghouls.
