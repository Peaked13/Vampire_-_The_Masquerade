Merits & Flaws:
	Bad Sight (1 pt. Flaw, V20 Core pg. 481):
		Can wear glasses for it, or it would be more points.

		2 extra dice for Leadership rolls.
	Enchanting Voice (2 pt. Merit, Core pg. 480):
		-2 difficulty for "all die rolls involving the use of the voice to persuade, charm or command"
		As written, sounds like it should affect disciplines.
			Though that certainly makes it powerful. As such many internet posts argued against it.
	Boons Owed (6 pt. Flaw, V20 Core pg. 488):
		2 pt. boon owed to Morgan Durley, the Tremere Primogen:
			-You formally requested and were granted permission to operate your "blood testing"
			 research startup, it being adjacent to the Tremere Primogen's domain of hospitals,
			 blood banks, and emergency services.
		2 pt. boon owed to Kenneth Wright, the Ventrue Primogen:
			-For the introduction that made the above boon possible, and his assistance in winning
			 a favorable deal there.
				-Spreads the plot hooks across a couple of factions.
		2 pt. boon owed to your sire, Reece Dooley:
			-Though the Kindred of your city and Clan very much hold him responsible for his childe,
			 you very much feel indebted to your sire for your agoge (Ventrue post-Embrace training
			 period), something your sire very much encouraged. He created you for a reason, after
			 all. He means to see a return on his investment, and that no shame is brought to him.
			 You, meanwhile, see the potential for much dignitas in repaying, rather than shirking,
			 a debt you didn't exactly sign yourself up for.

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-As a mortal:
		-
	-You took the idea of tech startup personality cults and ran with it.
		-Your retainers and herd are all part of the network of small startups you control
			-Your herd talk of you having a dose of Steve Jobs's "reality distortion field". If only
			 they knew. . .
		-In fact, your feeding restriction (Ventrue weakness) is that you only drink from those
		 who hold options in one of your companies.
			-Options being indicative of current employees, as opposed to shares sold to investors.
				-Employees have been vetted in some way, and you hold high standards.
					-You *may* have also peeked at some medical and insurance records you really
					 shouldn't have access to. All the companies in your network are clients of your
					 HR Automation and medical-focused Employee Assistance Program (with "AI"!) ones.
					-Yeah, lean into the health records angle: "Feed from any random kine?!? That's
					 disgusting, a recipe for disease or worse. I keep a carefully vetted herd. . ."
						-Options probably aren't enough, if you don't have the records access. But,
						 neither is the access alone sufficent (like, say, 3rd-party customers of the
						 HR and EAP firms). They're just not. . . yours.
				-Investors are often times those you plan to bilk, diverting the money to your own ends
				 from a company you plan to let fail.
					-Others may be representative of other Kindred you've cut in on some deal.
	-Lesley's background questions:
		-How old are you?
			-When were you born? How old were you when you were Embraced? How long have you existed
			 as a vampire? How old do you look? Are you more mature than you seem? Less?
				-You were embraced at age 26, close to a decade ago. Your apparent youthfulness is
				 an asset in your industry, though. You actually go out of your way to bring that up
				 occasionally, hinting at fictional cosmetic work or hair dye, as you'd like to hold
				 onto your mortal identity as possible. There are substantial assets and influence
				 tied to it.
					-TODO: Maybe that embrace should have been more recent, since the agoge seems to
						   rarely last more than a year, and because Lesley said we're fledglings.
				-If this is roughly the current date, as seems so, you were born in the late 80's.
		-What was unique about your childhood?
			-How did you spend your early years? How were
			your basic motivations and attitudes forged? Where
			did you go to school? Who were your immediate
			family? What is your clearest childhood memory?
			Did you go to high school? Did you have a hometown,
			or was your family constantly on the move?
			Did you go to college? Did you run away from
			home? Did you play sports? Did any of your childhood
			friendships last to adulthood?
		-What kind of person were you?
			-Were you a decent person, or were you an asshole?
			-Were you popular? Did you have a family?
			-How did you earn a living? Did you have any real
			friends? What kept you going from day to day? Will
			anyone miss you?
		-What was your first brush with the supernatural?
			-When did you realize you were being stalked?
				-You had a sense of. . . someone closing in on you well before your embrace, but
				 you had believed it to be in the service of some kind of investment or buy out.
				 Though you did not meet your sire before your embrace, you met numerous people you
				 now know to have been proxies for him, prospective investors and supposed
				 journalists that seemed a lot more interested in you than any particular company
				 you were involved with. You knew _something_ was coming, but you never suspected
				 just what. . .
			-Did you believe in the occult before your Embrace?
				-Nope, but you _do_ pride yourself on your ability to quickly pivot. . .
			-When did you first meet a vampire? Were you afraid? Disbelieving? Angry? What
			 frightened you most?
				-Your sire was the first of the Kindred you met, and only on the night of your
				 embrace. You reacted with disbelief when he reveal just what his plans for you were,
				 with your assessment of the situation going from joke, to prank, and finally to 
				 horror only as your life ended.
		-How did the Embrace change you?
			-How did your sire catch you? Was the Embrace
			painful? Did you get a kinky pleasure out of it? Did
			the Hunger tear at you? Did it frighten you? Did
			it feel right? Are you grateful to your sire? Do you
			want to kill him for what he did to you?
		-Who was your sire, and how did he treat you?
			-What do you know of your sire? Was he abusive, arrogant, cryptic. or open? Why do you
			 think he chose you? Did you even know your sire at all?
				-Your sire is Reece Dooley, a fellow resident of New York City.
					-_His_ sire is Kenneth Wright, the Ventrue Primogen of NYC.
				-In some ways, your sire's story mirrors your own. He was an East coast shipping
				 magnate, embraced in the late 18th century. During your agoge, Reece was quite
				 frank with you that his sire chose him for his expertise, seeking purchase in a
				 rapidly globalizing world, and also that he done the same with you, looking for
				 someone that could aid him in this now _digitally_ globalized world.
			-How long did you stay with your sire? Did he teach you anything at all? How long was
			 your “apprenticeship”?
				-Reece arranged for you the typical Ventrue agoge, lasting for more than a year. It
				 was harsh, but even more thorough, a fact you came to appreciate once you were
				 presented to the Prince and began to see the ignorant, thrown-together nature of
				 your fellow fledglings from other clans.
				-You're grateful to Reece for the more robust induction into your new (un)life, the
				 knowledge and introductions he provided you being the same sort of thing you made
				 your old _living_ on too. Reece has also done more than a bit to encourage that
				 gratitude. After all, he sired you for a purpose, and means to see a return on that
				 investment. You, meanwhile, also see the potential for much dignitas in repaying,
				 rather than shirking, a debt, even though you didn't exactly sign yourself up for it.
			-Where did you stay? Where did you go?
				-Just like your mortal life, you stuck to the city. Alive or dead, it's still the
				 beating heart of the world, filled with even more opportunities than you knew.
			-Did you meet any other vampires during that time
			(such as the Prince or Archbishop)? Do you judge
			other vampires in general by your opinion of your
			sire? When did he teach you the laws of your Sect?
		-How did you meet the others in your coterie?
			-Were you brought together by chance or design?
			-Are you all of one Sect? Are you united in purpose
			and attitude? How long have you been together in
			the city? Did you know any of the others before the
			Embrace? Are your sires in cooperation, or are they
			rivals? What holds your coterie together when things
			are at their worst?
		-Where is your haven?
			-Where do you hide during the day? Do you have
			a permanent home at all? Do you stay in the place
			you inhabited in your mortal life? Do you hide in
			an abandoned building? The sewers? Do you have
			anyone to protect you during the day?
		-Do you retain any connections to your mortal life?
			-Are you presumed dead? Do you still watch over relatives from afar? Do you pretend to
			 be still alive?
				-You had substantial wealth and influence before your embrace, and have every
				 intention of hanging onto very direct control of those resources as long as you
				 can. You're even already laying the groundwork for the lies to sustain that,
				 alluding to cosmetic surgeries you've had ("A youthful image is critical in our
				 forward-looking industry. . .") and extreme diets for health and longevity ("I'm on
				 a calorie restricted greens-and-soylent regimen these days. But, please, eat! It's_
				 still on me!").
				-You were never the most dutiful son, always busy with your latest business as a
				 mortal, so keeping family at arms length since your embrace has proved no great
				 difficulty. Though your parents are only upstate, you haven't seen them, or your
				 brother in Knoxville, in years now. They'd always seemed happier with a "big shot
				 son" to brag about, and the occasional lavish gift, than the reality of you taking
				 taking work calls on Christmas anyways.
			-Did you abandon your mortal existence entirely?
				-Nope!
		-What are your habitual feeding grounds?
			-Whom do you feed upon, and where? Do you have a territory that you consider exclusively
			 yours? Is your favorite hunting ground used by others? Do you compete with others? What
			 is your preferred prey? Do you ever kill when you feed? Do you have a specific herd? Do
			 you seduce your prey? Kidnap them? Assault them on the street? Do they come to you?
				-As a Ventrue, you have a specific feeding restriction, detailed above (search for
				 "your feeding restriction"). Given the nature of the restriction, you feed
				 exclusively from your herd, and do so through deception.
				-Your companies run a series of blood drives, free blood tests, and donations for
				 "cutting edge medical research", all pressuring the employees of your businesses
				 to turn over their blood under the comforting supervision of a nurse. It's all
				 voluntary, of course, but you take a personal interest in the various causes, and
				 can be very persuasive.
				-This also offers on opportunity for vitae to flow the other way too. You've been
				 known to offer key personnel "the opportunity to participate in a research study
				 for a cutting edge performance enhancement technique. It's like blood-doping! It
				 might be banned in the Olympics, but it's practically a moral imperative if it
				 offers an edge to people engaged in Changing the World! You'll make a couple of
				 donations, and then receive an IV with your processed blood during crunch time.
				 Just don't go attempting any feats of Olypmic strength, ha! Seriously, though,
				 that might damage your muscles. But it's supposed to help the brain too, and sure
				 as hell _feels_ great!"
		-What motivates you?
			-Do you seek revenge on any enemies? Do you long to return to your mortal life? Do you
			 have ambitions in Kindred society? If you could achieve anything in the world, what
			 would it be?
				-You value the trappings of your mortal life, but don't miss it. Even then, your
				 intention had been to use tech to climb to the top, to carve out a chunk of the
				 world that was _yours_. Your eyes have been opened to new heights and new depths,
				 but the plan remains the same.
	-Your companies:
		-HR Automation firm, Apexi, with a medical-focused Employee Assistance Program (with "AI"!),
		 and a blood testing automation and medical research company, Energence:
			-These are almost wholly owned by you yourself, and are money-losing ventures.
			 Instead of seeking profit, they essentially act as the legally-above-the-board
			 mechanism by which you surveil people and buy their blood. You even write the loss
			 off on your taxes.
		-Security consultancy:
			-This one is also almost wholly owned by you, with the rest in the hands of it's
			 employees, among them all three of your retainers.
			-It, however, actually makes a profit, it being one of the ways by which you extract
			 money from your incestuous network of self-dealing companies.
			-It's also the primary mechanism by which you run your own security, digital,
			 electronic, physical all. You've purchased all sorts of equipment, and engaged the
			 the services of various contractors, through this company.
		-Naviuck, a logistics technology firm aiming for a buyout from a major shipping company:
			-This is typical of other companies in your past, and probably your future. It's
			 a decent idea, a plausible exit, and thus all you need to sell it to investors.
			-Maybe that acquisition will happen, maybe it won't. Either way, you'll extract more
			 money (and blood) from it than you put in, with any loss backstopped by the
			 investors you pitch it to.
				-If it looks like it's going to stick the landing, though, you'll likely engaged
				 in a kind of nepotism by offering stakes to your. . . Kindred, in return for
				 more intangible things.
			-The tech-talent cofounder insisted on the horrible name.
		-TODO: More?
			-Promising moonshot one? Tessearch, doing deep packet inspection stuff?
	-Your properties and havens:
		-Greenwich Village townhouse:
			-Your single most expensive splurge after the first time a company you were involved
			 with made it big. It's mortgaged, but still a substantial status symbol, and close
			 to a lot of the action in the city's startup scene.
			-These days, it features extensive security cameras on an airgapped network, an
			 expensive fire suppression system, alarms, and reinforced doors. The basement also
			 has a fortified and secured "panic room".
		-You have access to variety of rented offices belonging to your companies:
			-You maintain a haven at your security consultancy (a secured, windowless storage room)
			 in Brooklyn. The consultancy's employees spend most of their time remote, but it
			 maintains rented storage and office space in an old manufacturing building, providing
			 equipment storage, workshops, meeting space, and a loading dock where your van is
			 generally kept.
			-You also have a haven at your blood testing firm (a combo-locked walk-in freezer, with
			 "safety" escape handle inside. It's located in the Flatiron District, a short distance
			 from your townhouse.
		-All of your above havens feature regularly consumed and refreshed refridgerated blood,
		 taken from the blood testing firm's supply (Your herd. System?).
		-Bug out haven:
			-Located in Cherrytown, NY a bit more than two hour's drive outside the city:
			 https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cherrytown,+NY+12446/@40.7328324,-74.2566578,10z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!2sNew+York,+NY!3b1!8m2!3d40.7127753!4d-74.0059728!3m4!1s0x89dce6d92ceaded5:0x9d2c32606c32ffac!8m2!3d41.8250923!4d-74.3293333?hl=en
			-A small rural cabin, with an old root cellar below the cabin.
				-The old external entrance to the cellar was bricked up by Mr. Hubbard and then
				 filled with dirt, in favor of a section of closet floor cut and now removable.
			-Purchased with Mr. Hubbard's alternate identity.
			-You've never even been there, mindful of your sire's warnings of. . . things in the
			 wilderness between the cities. Better to have the option than to not, though.

Equipment:
	-Cellphone running Horton's customized Android build.
		-Adapter cables, for connecting the cellphone to all sorts of devices.
		-TODO: Flesh out what's on the phone somewhere. Improved security, call encryption, pen.
			   testing tools, etc.
	-Expensive tailored suit, artfully rumpled.
	-Spare pair of glasses.
	-Cars:
		-Fancy sedan (armored)
			-Paranoid chic is often in, in tech circles, helping you stand out _just_ the right amount.
			-It's also had a limo-style refridgerated mini-bar installed, though it seldom contains liquor.
		-White cargo van

		 lets you identify a _mortal's_ nature from a single statment (if you succeed on Int+Emp vs.
		 difficulty of their Manip+Exp). _Potentially_ useful.

		-Denial Of Aphrodite's Kiss (D3/P3), making generation impact Presence like Dominate, seems tempting, now that you're higher gen than originally planned.
		-Measure The Will (A2/D2) determines Willpower and virtues, and found here: https://mowcadah.proboards.com/thread/31/combination-disciplines
