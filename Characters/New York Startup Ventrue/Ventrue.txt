Merits & Flaws:
	Bad Sight (1 pt. Flaw, V20 Core pg. 481)
		Can wear glasses for it, or it would be more points.
	Natural Leader (1 pt. Merit, Core pg. 300)
		2 extra dice for Leadership rolls.
	Enchanting Voice (2 pt. Merit, Core pg. 296)
		-2 difficulty for "all die rolls involving the use of the voice to persuade, charm or command"
		As written, sounds like it should affect disciplines.
			Though that certainly makes it powerful. As such many internet posts argued against it.
	TODO: Lesley suggested owing a boon for another Flaw, to get stuff like "clan status, or for a
		  point of influence (tech industry)"
		-He recommended probably avoiding Status, since he's aiming for starting us as fledglings.
		-Maybe Domain?
			-It reads more like physical territory, which is not exactly what you're going for, but,
			 for Domain 2, it could be an office building you own, housing your companies.
		-Boon for access to something in the city? Finance? Maybe bloodbank-adjacent activity, to
		 the Tremere?
		-Hmm. . . neither V20 Core or any of the likely seeming Revised books seem to what exactly
		 constitutes a boon of a given point value.
			-Nor that you can take _owed_ boons, but it seems obvious enough how to flip the sign.

Freebie points: 13 (15 - 2 from Merits and Flaws)
	7 Dominate 1
	5 additional backgrounds
	1 Willpower 5
		Should I switch this to Status 1? TODO: Ask Lesley.

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-As a mortal:
		-
	-You took the idea of tech startup personality cults and ran with it.
		-Your retainers and herd are all part of the network of small startups you control
			-Your herd talk of you having a dose of Steve Jobs's "reality distortion field". If only
			 they knew. . .
		-In fact, your feeding restriction (Ventrue weakness) is that you only drink from those
		 who hold options in one of your companies.
			-Options being indicative of current employees, as opposed to shares sold to investors.
				-Employees have been vetted in some way, and you hold high standards.
					-You *may* have also peeked at some medical and insurance records you really
					 shouldn't have access to. All the companies in your network are clients of your
					 HR Automation and medical-focused Employee Assistance Program (with "AI"!) ones.
				-Investors are often times those you plan to bilk, diverting the money to your own ends
				 from a company you plan to let fail.
					-Others may be representative of other Kindred you've cut in on some deal.
			-A less restrictive option would be something like programmers in general, should this
			 character be used for a more mobile game, where this would be unsuitable.

Equipment (stuff to start with or obtain):
	TODO


TODO:
	-Answer the background questions in Roll20.
	-Flesh out your retainers.
		-All ghouls?
			-Creation rules for them are on pg. 496 of V20 Core.
		-Hacker-Seneschal?
		-2 body guards?
			-Both ex-military.
			-One who went in to tech. Secruity focus.
			-Other went merc, Blackwater-esque. Crueler.


Advancement:
	-Tentative schedule:
		5  Dominate 2
		10 Dominate 3
		6  Empathy 3
		15 Presence 4
		16 Charisma 5
		10 Fortitude 1
		5  Fortitude 2
		15 Dominate 4
		10 Fortitude 3
		20 Presence 5
	-Interesting coterie Disciplines:
		-Essentially all the Malkavian Disciplines.
			-Lots of combos of interest, especially with Auspex and Obfuscate.
			-Some Dementation powers also dovetail with your abilities, but it's a poor flavor fit.
	-Combos:
		-Useful links:
			-Descriptions of many combos, sans reference pg. numbers: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines
			-Names, sans description, with reference numbers: https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Combination_Disciplines_(VTM)
		-Clanbook Ventrue pg 77. has a 4 experience combo, Lifesong, that you already qualify for. It
		 lets you identify a _mortal's_ nature from a single statment (if you succeed on Int+Emp vs.
		 difficulty of their Manip+Exp). _Potentially_ useful.
		-Honeyed Words would be amazing if you pick up Auspex 2 and can learn it: 	https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Honeyed_Words_.28Auspex_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.29
		-Ah, Impeccable Manners is similar for different social skills, and explicitly a Ventrue thing: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Impeccable_Manners_.28Auspex_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.29
		-Rescue Beacon (Fortitude 1 and Presence 4) calls you're nearest ghoul if staked or torpid: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Rescue_Beacon_.28Fortitude_.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Just need Fortitude 1 to get Retaliatory Terror. Explicitly Ventrue, allows reflexive Dread
		 Gazes if Brawl or Melee damage is taken: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Retaliatory_Terror_.28Fortitude_.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Already qualify for Unflinching Stare-down, though only useful if combat heavy: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Unflinching_Stare-down_.28Dominate_.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Marshal the Posse (D2/P3) would be another possibly useful combat one: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Marshal_the_Posse_.28Dominate_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Aura of Inescapable Truth is an eventual super power for you (D4/P4): https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Aura_of_Inescapable_Truth_.28Dominate_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Chain of Slavery (A2/D2) determines if someone is Dominated, and by who: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Chain_of_Slavery_.28Auspex_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Dominate_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Exquisite Corpse (F3/Obf3) is _way_ off and combat focused, but _so_ flavorful: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Exquisite_Corpse_.28Fortitude_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Obfuscate_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
