Merits & Flaws:
	Bad Sight (1 pt. Flaw, V20 Core pg. 481):
		Can wear glasses for it, or it would be more points.
	Natural Leader (1 pt. Merit, Core pg. 487):
		2 extra dice for Leadership rolls.
	Enchanting Voice (2 pt. Merit, Core pg. 480):
		-2 difficulty for "all die rolls involving the use of the voice to persuade, charm or command"
		As written, sounds like it should affect disciplines.
			Though that certainly makes it powerful. As such many internet posts argued against it.
	Boons Owed (6 pt. Flaw, V20 Core pg. 488):
		2 pt. boon owed to Morgan Durley, the Tremere Primogen:
			-You formally requested and were granted permission to operate your "blood testing"
			 research startup, it being adjacent to the Tremere Primogen's domain of hospitals,
			 blood banks, and emergency services.
		2 pt. boon owed to Kenneth Wright, the Ventrue Primogen:
			-For the introduction that made the above boon possible, and his assistance in winning
			 a favorable deal there.
				-Spreads the plot hooks across a couple of factions.
		2 pt. boon owed to your sire, Reece Dooley:
			-Though the Kindred of your city and Clan very much hold him responsible for his childe,
			 you very much feel indebted to your sire for your agoge (Ventrue post-Embrace training
			 period), something your sire very much encouraged. He created you for a reason, after
			 all. He means to see a return on his investment, and that no shame is brought to him.
			 You, meanwhile, see the potential for much dignitas in repaying, rather than shirking,
			 a debt you didn't exactly sign yourself up for.

	*	5  Dominate 2
	*	10 Dominate 3
	*	4  Subterfuge 3
	*	6  Subterfuge 4 (Impeccable Lies specialty!)
		15 Presence 4

		20 Presence 5, or sooner?
		4  Empathy 3
		10 Fortitude 3
		12 Manipulation 4 (specialty!)
		15 Dominate 4

	-Add some more attribute and ability increases to that? Remember that going over 3 gets your a
	 free specialty.
		16 Manipulation 5
		8  Intimidation 5
		6  Leadership 4 (Oratory specialty)?
		4  Politics 3
		6  Politics 4 (Camarilla specialty!)
	-Virtues (current x 2) and Willpower (current) are both cheap for what they do.
		-Self-Control and Courage are both already 4, but Willpower would be huge for you.
	-Add some Auspex, and then some combos?
		-Honeyed Words would be amazing if you pick up Auspex 2 and can learn it: 	https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Honeyed_Words_.28Auspex_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.29
		-Ah, Impeccable Manners is similar for different social skills, and explicitly a Ventrue thing: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Impeccable_Manners_.28Auspex_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.29
		-Measure The Will (A2/D2) determines Willpower and virtues, and found here: https://mowcadah.proboards.com/thread/31/combination-disciplines
		-Mr. Nightwalker now has it too, and a minor bond to a Gangrel might be preferable to a
		 Tremere or Malkavian, especially given his other, _clan_ disciplines.
	-There are some combos you'd really like even without extra disciplines:
		-Marshal the Posse (D2/P3) would be another possibly useful combat one: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Marshal_the_Posse_.28Dominate_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Aura of Inescapable Truth is an eventual super power for you (D4/P4): https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Aura_of_Inescapable_Truth_.28Dominate_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
	-Interesting coterie Disciplines:
		-Essentially all the Malkavian Disciplines.
			-Lots of combos of interest, especially with Auspex and Obfuscate.
			-Some Dementation powers also dovetail with your abilities, especially the first, but
			 all but that one are poor flavor fits.
				-The first is especially good for you.
				-A couple of combos do similarly interesting social stuff too.
				-However, needing a derrangement to do any of this is kind of a dealbreaker.
		-Ah, learning them, though, is costly, requiring a step towards the blood bond: https://discord.com/channels/930231429286207539/930231429286207542/944287129670922271
			-That first step isn't _terrible_ (V20 Core pg. 287), but is not something you'd take
			 lightly.
	-Combos:
		-Useful links:
			-Descriptions of many combos, sans reference pg. numbers: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines
			-Names, sans description, with reference numbers: https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Combination_Disciplines_(VTM)
			-Ah, this has both: https://mowcadah.proboards.com/thread/31/combination-disciplines
		-Clanbook Ventrue pg 77. has a 4 experience combo, Lifesong, that you already qualify for. It
		 lets you identify a _mortal's_ nature from a single statment (if you succeed on Int+Emp vs.
		 difficulty of their Manip+Exp). _Potentially_ useful.
		-Honeyed Words (A2/P1 would be amazing if you can learn it (text mentions "viziers"): https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Honeyed_Words_.28Auspex_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.29

			-The overlap of these two isn't clear. Could be entire, or they might allow a different range of things each.
		-Rescue Beacon (Fortitude 1 and Presence 4) calls your nearest ghoul if staked or torpid: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Rescue_Beacon_.28Fortitude_.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Just need Fortitude 1 to get Retaliatory Terror. Explicitly Ventrue, allows reflexive Dread
		 Gazes if Brawl or Melee damage is taken: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Retaliatory_Terror_.28Fortitude_.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Already qualify for Unflinching Stare-down, though only useful if combat heavy: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Unflinching_Stare-down_.28Dominate_.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29

			-Ah, source for these old west ones is dubious. Haven't found it anywhere else online, but this does exist: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/329428/Vampire-The-Wild-West
		-Aura of Inescapable Truth is an eventual super power for you (D4/P4): https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Aura_of_Inescapable_Truth_.28Dominate_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Presence_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Chain of Slavery (A2/D2) determines if someone is Dominated, and by who: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Chain_of_Slavery_.28Auspex_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Dominate_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Exquisite Corpse (F3/Obf3) is _way_ off and combat focused, but _so_ flavorful: https://saligia.fandom.com/wiki/Combination_Disciplines#Exquisite_Corpse_.28Fortitude_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.2C_Obfuscate_.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.E2.80.A2.29
		-Denial Of Aphrodite's Kiss (D3/P3), making generation impact Presence like Dominate, seems tempting, now that you're higher gen than originally planned.
		-Measure The Will (A2/D2) determines Willpower and virtues, and found here: https://mowcadah.proboards.com/thread/31/combination-disciplines
	-Earn backgrounds? Or even social merits?!?
		-It's undefined how increasing these works, but clearly you can earn more money, gain more
		 retainers, etc.
		-These are also a major focus for you in general.
		-Which backgrounds?
			-Allies, Contacts, Influence, or Status might be interesting options, especially as you
			 embed yourself more in the city and politics.
			-Domain would be a challenge, only really possible if story introduces it. Good, though.
			-Herd, though, you can easily gain. You haven't burned much blood, but could.
			-Resources is a possibility. You're already rich, but more is better.
			-Ah, Retainers is also easy-ish to gain, and amazing. Could work towards that.
				-Might be some politics involved? Lesley briefly hinted at a childe-style limit.
		-Which merits?
			-Elysium Regular?
