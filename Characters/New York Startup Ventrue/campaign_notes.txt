Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-As a mortal:
		-
	-You took the idea of tech startup personality cults and ran with it.
		-Your retainers and herd are all part of the network of small startups you control
			-Your herd talk of you having a dose of Steve Jobs's "reality distortion field". If only
			 they knew. . .
		-In fact, your feeding restriction (Ventrue weakness) is that you only drink from those
		 who hold options in one of your companies.
			-Options being indicative of current employees, as opposed to shares sold to investors.
				-Employees have been vetted in some way, and you hold high standards.
					-You *may* have also peeked at some medical and insurance records you really
					 shouldn't have access to. All the companies in your network are clients of your
					 HR Automation and medical-focused Employee Assistance Program (with "AI"!) ones.
					-Yeah, lean into the health records angle: "Feed from any random kine?!? That's
					 disgusting, a recipe for disease or worse. I keep a carefully vetted herd. . ."
						-Options probably aren't enough, if you don't have the records access. But,
						 neither is the access alone sufficent (like, say, 3rd-party customers of the
						 HR and EAP firms). They're just not. . . yours.
				-Investors are often times those you plan to bilk, diverting the money to your own ends
				 from a company you plan to let fail.
					-Others may be representative of other Kindred you've cut in on some deal.
	-Lesley's background questions:
		-How old are you?
			-When were you born? How old were you when you were Embraced? How long have you existed
			 as a vampire? How old do you look? Are you more mature than you seem? Less?
				-You were embraced at age 26, close to a decade ago. Your apparent youthfulness is
				 an asset in your industry, though. You actually go out of your way to bring that up
				 occasionally, hinting at fictional cosmetic work or hair dye, as you'd like to hold
				 onto your mortal identity as possible. There are substantial assets and influence
				 tied to it.
					-TODO: Maybe that embrace should have been more recent, since the agoge seems to
						   rarely last more than a year, and because Lesley said we're fledglings.
				-If this is roughly the current date, as seems so, you were born in the late 80's.
		-What was unique about your childhood?
			-How did you spend your early years? How were
			your basic motivations and attitudes forged? Where
			did you go to school? Who were your immediate
			family? What is your clearest childhood memory?
			Did you go to high school? Did you have a hometown,
			or was your family constantly on the move?
			Did you go to college? Did you run away from
			home? Did you play sports? Did any of your childhood
			friendships last to adulthood?
		-What kind of person were you?
			-Were you a decent person, or were you an asshole?
			-Were you popular? Did you have a family?
			-How did you earn a living? Did you have any real
			friends? What kept you going from day to day? Will
			anyone miss you?
		-What was your first brush with the supernatural?
			-When did you realize you were being stalked?
				-You had a sense of. . . someone closing in on you well before your embrace, but
				 you had believed it to be in the service of some kind of investment or buy out.
				 Though you did not meet your sire before your embrace, you met numerous people you
				 now know to have been proxies for him, prospective investors and supposed
				 journalists that seemed a lot more interested in you than any particular company
				 you were involved with. You knew _something_ was coming, but you never suspected
				 just what. . .
			-Did you believe in the occult before your Embrace?
				-Nope, but you _do_ pride yourself on your ability to quickly pivot. . .
			-When did you first meet a vampire? Were you afraid? Disbelieving? Angry? What
			 frightened you most?
				-Your sire was the first of the Kindred you met, and only on the night of your
				 embrace. You reacted with disbelief when he reveal just what his plans for you were,
				 with your assessment of the situation going from joke, to prank, and finally to 
				 horror only as your life ended.
		-How did the Embrace change you?
			-How did your sire catch you? Was the Embrace
			painful? Did you get a kinky pleasure out of it? Did
			the Hunger tear at you? Did it frighten you? Did
			it feel right? Are you grateful to your sire? Do you
			want to kill him for what he did to you?
		-Who was your sire, and how did he treat you?
			-What do you know of your sire? Was he abusive, arrogant, cryptic. or open? Why do you
			 think he chose you? Did you even know your sire at all?
				-Your sire is Reece Dooley, a fellow resident of New York City.
					-_His_ sire is Kenneth Wright, the Ventrue Primogen of NYC.
				-In some ways, your sire's story mirrors your own. He was an East coast shipping
				 magnate, embraced in the late 18th century. During your agoge, Reece was quite
				 frank with you that his sire chose him for his expertise, seeking purchase in a
				 rapidly globalizing world, and also that he done the same with you, looking for
				 someone that could aid him in this now _digitally_ globalized world.
			-How long did you stay with your sire? Did he teach you anything at all? How long was
			 your “apprenticeship”?
				-Reece arranged for you the typical Ventrue agoge, lasting for more than a year. It
				 was harsh, but even more thorough, a fact you came to appreciate once you were
				 presented to the Prince and began to see the ignorant, thrown-together nature of
				 your fellow fledglings from other clans.
				-You're grateful to Reece for the more robust induction into your new (un)life, the
				 knowledge and introductions he provided you being the same sort of thing you made
				 your old _living_ on too. Reece has also done more than a bit to encourage that
				 gratitude. After all, he sired you for a purpose, and means to see a return on that
				 investment. You, meanwhile, also see the potential for much dignitas in repaying,
				 rather than shirking, a debt, even though you didn't exactly sign yourself up for it.
			-Where did you stay? Where did you go?
				-Just like your mortal life, you stuck to the city. Alive or dead, it's still the
				 beating heart of the world, filled with even more opportunities than you knew.
			-Did you meet any other vampires during that time
			(such as the Prince or Archbishop)? Do you judge
			other vampires in general by your opinion of your
			sire? When did he teach you the laws of your Sect?
		-How did you meet the others in your coterie?
			-Were you brought together by chance or design?
			-Are you all of one Sect? Are you united in purpose
			and attitude? How long have you been together in
			the city? Did you know any of the others before the
			Embrace? Are your sires in cooperation, or are they
			rivals? What holds your coterie together when things
			are at their worst?
		-Where is your haven?
			-Where do you hide during the day? Do you have
			a permanent home at all? Do you stay in the place
			you inhabited in your mortal life? Do you hide in
			an abandoned building? The sewers? Do you have
			anyone to protect you during the day?
		-Do you retain any connections to your mortal life?
			-Are you presumed dead? Do you still watch over relatives from afar? Do you pretend to
			 be still alive?
				-You had substantial wealth and influence before your embrace, and have every
				 intention of hanging onto very direct control of those resources as long as you
				 can. You're even already laying the groundwork for the lies to sustain that,
				 alluding to cosmetic surgeries you've had ("A youthful image is critical in our
				 forward-looking industry. . .") and extreme diets for health and longevity ("I'm on
				 a calorie restricted greens-and-soylent regimen these days. But, please, eat! It's_
				 still on me!").
				-You were never the most dutiful son, always busy with your latest business as a
				 mortal, so keeping family at arms length since your embrace has proved no great
				 difficulty. Though your parents are only upstate, you haven't seen them, or your
				 brother in Knoxville, in years now. They'd always seemed happier with a "big shot
				 son" to brag about, and the occasional lavish gift, than the reality of you taking
				 taking work calls on Christmas anyways.
			-Did you abandon your mortal existence entirely?
				-Nope!
		-What are your habitual feeding grounds?
			-Whom do you feed upon, and where? Do you have a territory that you consider exclusively
			 yours? Is your favorite hunting ground used by others? Do you compete with others? What
			 is your preferred prey? Do you ever kill when you feed? Do you have a specific herd? Do
			 you seduce your prey? Kidnap them? Assault them on the street? Do they come to you?
				-As a Ventrue, you have a specific feeding restriction, detailed above (search for
				 "your feeding restriction"). Given the nature of the restriction, you feed
				 exclusively from your herd, and do so through deception.
				-Your companies run a series of blood drives, free blood tests, and donations for
				 "cutting edge medical research", all pressuring the employees of your businesses
				 to turn over their blood under the comforting supervision of a nurse. It's all
				 voluntary, of course, but you take a personal interest in the various causes, and
				 can be very persuasive.
				-This also offers on opportunity for vitae to flow the other way too. You've been
				 known to offer key personnel "the opportunity to participate in a research study
				 for a cutting edge performance enhancement technique. It's like blood-doping! It
				 might be banned in the Olympics, but it's practically a moral imperative if it
				 offers an edge to people engaged in Changing the World! You'll make a couple of
				 donations, and then receive an IV with your processed blood during crunch time.
				 Just don't go attempting any feats of Olypmic strength, ha! Seriously, though,
				 that might damage your muscles. But it's supposed to help the brain too, and sure
				 as hell _feels_ great!"
		-What motivates you?
			-Do you seek revenge on any enemies? Do you long to return to your mortal life? Do you
			 have ambitions in Kindred society? If you could achieve anything in the world, what
			 would it be?
				-You value the trappings of your mortal life, but don't miss it. Even then, your
				 intention had been to use tech to climb to the top, to carve out a chunk of the
				 world that was _yours_. Your eyes have been opened to new heights and new depths,
				 but the plan remains the same.
	-Your companies:
		-HR Automation firm, Apexi, with a medical-focused Employee Assistance Program (with "AI"!),
		 and a blood testing automation and medical research company, Energence:
			-These are almost wholly owned by you yourself, and are money-losing ventures.
			 Instead of seeking profit, they essentially act as the legally-above-the-board
			 mechanism by which you surveil people and buy their blood. You even write the loss
			 off on your taxes.
		-Security consultancy:
			-This one is also almost wholly owned by you, with the rest in the hands of it's
			 employees, among them all three of your retainers.
			-It, however, actually makes a profit, it being one of the ways by which you extract
			 money from your incestuous network of self-dealing companies.
			-It's also the primary mechanism by which you run your own security, digital,
			 electronic, physical all. You've purchased all sorts of equipment, and engaged the
			 the services of various contractors, through this company.
		-Naviuck, a logistics technology firm aiming for a buyout from a major shipping company:
			-This is typical of other companies in your past, and probably your future. It's
			 a decent idea, a plausible exit, and thus all you need to sell it to investors.
			-Maybe that acquisition will happen, maybe it won't. Either way, you'll extract more
			 money (and blood) from it than you put in, with any loss backstopped by the
			 investors you pitch it to.
				-If it looks like it's going to stick the landing, though, you'll likely engaged
				 in a kind of nepotism by offering stakes to your. . . Kindred, in return for
				 more intangible things.
			-The tech-talent cofounder insisted on the horrible name.
		-TODO: More?
			-Promising moonshot one? Research, doing deep packet inspection stuff?
	-Your properties and havens:
		-Greenwich Village townhouse:
			-Your single most expensive splurge after the first time a company you were involved
			 with made it big. It's mortgaged, but still a substantial status symbol, and close
			 to a lot of the action in the city's startup scene.
			-These days, it features extensive security cameras on an airgapped network, an
			 expensive fire suppression system, alarms, and reinforced doors. The basement also
			 has a fortified and secured "panic room".
		-You have access to variety of rented offices belonging to your companies:
			-You maintain a haven at your security consultancy (a secured, windowless storage room)
			 in Brooklyn. The consultancy's employees spend most of their time remote, but it
			 maintains rented storage and office space in an old manufacturing building, providing
			 equipment storage, workshops, meeting space, and a loading dock where your van is
			 generally kept.
			-You also have a haven at your blood testing firm (a combo-locked walk-in freezer, with
			 "safety" escape handle inside. It's located in the Flatiron District, a short distance
			 from your townhouse.
		-All of your above havens feature regularly consumed and refreshed refridgerated blood,
		 taken from the blood testing firm's supply (Your herd. System?).
		-Bug out haven:
			-Located in Cherrytown, NY a bit more than two hour's drive outside the city:
			 https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cherrytown,+NY+12446/@40.7328324,-74.2566578,10z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x89c24fa5d33f083b:0xc80b8f06e177fe62!2sNew+York,+NY!3b1!8m2!3d40.7127753!4d-74.0059728!3m4!1s0x89dce6d92ceaded5:0x9d2c32606c32ffac!8m2!3d41.8250923!4d-74.3293333?hl=en
			-A small rural cabin, with an old root cellar below the cabin.
				-The old external entrance to the cellar was bricked up by Mr. Hubbard and then
				 filled with dirt, in favor of a section of closet floor cut and now removable.
			-Purchased with Mr. Hubbard's alternate identity.
			-You've never even been there, mindful of your sire's warnings of. . . things in the
			 wilderness between the cities. Better to have the option than to not, though.

Pregame stuff:
	-The social scene:
		-More aware of this than anyone else, but night 1 stuff for a Ventrue.
		-Harpies:
			-Handouts will be in Roll20 soon (for you).
			-Head is Malkavian painter / art historian.
		-You've been to a salon, unofficial Elysium-alikes hosted by various Harpies.
			-If no kine, no need for Masquerade.
			-Again if no kine, can get away with things like using disciplines on other kindred
			 that would not be allowable at Elysium.
				-Reason, maybe, to get invited to one or even set one up, if you want to get away
				 with something like that on Kindred (or even coterie members).
	-Write up specific goals for character or game, and give to Lesley.
		-In-Character goals:
			-Find an enduring place for yourself in Kindred society before your knowledge of the
			 moment runs thin.
			-Find your route to prominence, prestige, and power in a world where the competition's
			 headstart is measured in millenia. Fortunately, everything in your existance thus far
			 has prepared you to profit from "disruption."
		-Personal goals:
			-Explore the Social Abilities and Disciplines.
			-Explore Camarilla politics, and the tension of being a neonate in a methuselah's world.
				-The latter is a good bit of what I'm going for with the notion of Mr. Nielsen being
				 embraced for tech expertise and trying to find an enduring place for himself, surfing
				 the new developments of the kine.
			-Play around with Backgrounds.
	-The Camarilla has some concerns around electronics, and their risk of breaking The Masquerade:
		-Discussed in chat here: https://discord.com/channels/930231429286207539/930231429286207542/938566003657408592
		-Talking to Lesley, you've gotten the dispensation required, given what you've built your
		 (un)life around and what you provide.
	-It's more or less the current date, and COVID is a thing.
		-In 2005, a kind of Camarilla social network, thought to be one of the most secure of it's
		 kind in existence, was hacked. The locations of many havens were exposed to a group calling
		 itself "The Second Inquisition", resulting in these kine destroying many Kindred.
			-The biggest loss was the newly awakened Prince of London, Mithras, rumored to have been
			 millenia old.
			-This led to a backlash against technology in The Camarilla, and a ban on the use social
			 media without permission.
				-As mentioned above, you've received that dispensation.
		-It's been 20 years since the doomsday cultists of The Sabbat were driven from New York City.
			-Calebros later stepped down, in 2005, refusing to continue as Prince, though he still
			 lives in the city's sewers somewhere, contributing to unusual Nosferatu political
			 prominence to this day.
				-Severl of the Primogen he named are still in place too, the Brujah, Malkavian, and
				 Nosferatu Primogens, with their clans taking on unusual prominence in the city.
				-That came at the cost of the usually on top, Ventrue and Toreador in particular,
				 with the Toreador taking it hardest.
					-Their Primogen, in particular, seethes about the subject, and is always eager to
		-Prince Hellene Panhard has ruled the city since 2005.
			-Made in 1999, she's the childe of a former Prince of NYC, the one, in fact, who ruled
			 from it's founding until it's loss to The Sabbat.
			-Seen as something of a libral, she has even made treaties with the anarchs in The Bronx.
			-She is also instrumental in keeping The Sabbat out of the city, by means of a formidable
			 spy network. Most assume she has Federal connections.


2/2/22: It Began on a Twosday. . .
	-Elysium this evening was called by it's Keeper, Tony Perez, who contacted me through Ms. Veck.
		-He said that we'd lost a member of The Camarilla tonight.
		-My sire and I were thus chatting while looking around avidly, trying to see who's missing.
			-A Gangrel ancillae seemed to be missing, but I could not put a name to her face. . .
		-My clanmates also talked amongst themselves about on TODO (asian name), who is seeking to
		 embrace his secretary.
			-He has heavy interests in construction companies.
		-I also overheard a nearby table say that their friend "Evelyn" did not make it, and one of
		 them was even weeping over it.
			-They're caitiff.
			-I decided to approach the table, asking the weeping one, "What's the matter, Ms. . ."
				-Shockingly, as I approached, I realized those were actual _tears_ running down her
				 face, and she took a drink from a glass of water in front of her.
				-She said that her friend had been missing for weeks.
				-The whole affair elicited jeers from a Brujah at the other table, saying that no
				 one cares about the problems of these thinbloods, she's not really even one of us.
					-His fellows had to calm him, with mixed success, warning him against starting
					 a fight in Elysium.
				-Ignoring the Brujah, another of the caitiff asked me, "What do you care about our
				 problems?"
				 "I heard someone in distress, and wondered if there was any help I could offer."
				 That elicited a snort.
				 Another at the table then spoke up: "Hey! He's offering to _help_ Cat. Lay off."
				 "You want to help?" he responded, "Come down to the pier sometime, see what
				  bullshit we put up with."
				 "I would love to. Here, take my contact info," I said, handing him my card.
				-A dog also joined us, to match Ms. Cat. A well dressed Kindred, but clearly a
				 Gangrel by his yellow, cat-slit eyes, came over to express his sympathies as well,
				 also indicating that he makes it his business to find people.
					-I exchanged introductions and contact information with Mr. Cadusis, expressing
					 that finding people was a very useful talent indeed.
		-As the night went on, the sheriff, Garett Hawthorn, began to collect several kindred, my
		 sire among them, bringing them over to the Primogen.
		-Eventually, he also asked that the assembled Kindred return to their seats, as the Prince
		 came out and Garett began to  address the assembled.
			-He acknowledged that there had been disappearances of thinblooded in the city. He also
			 said he'd already told us all this, and so this was a warning too, to quit making a
			 scene in Elysium about it.
			-He then moved on to what seemed to be his main business, mentioning a letter saying
			 that a Gangrel, Effie May, would no longer be in the city.
				-She had looked after an important safehouse in the city, one open to all of us in
				 an emergency. That responsibility is now left vacant.
			-As such, a new coterie is to be established, to look after this haven.
			-He then asked for Sam Nier, Cadusis Nightwalker, and myself to step forward.
				-He spoke of us as promising, and trusted, neonates, and said we would thus be
				 entrusted with this task.
		-Prince Panhard then spoke up, saying there was another reason we'd all been called here.
			-"The Sabbat," she said, "are in the state again. There's been fighting in Rochester,
			 and as of tonight, Rochester is once again in Sabbat hands."
				-This caused the expected murmering from those assembled.
			-"We do not wish to cause panic. We have not seen numbers that would suggest a threat
			  to New York.
			  Rochester was left intentionally open, to gauge their strength if they returned to the
			  state. The city fell to only a single pack. Unfortunate, but no threat to our city.
			  I believe we can retake it.
			  In the meantime, I want everyone stay out of Staten Island. I am also giving a special
			  dispensation to our sheriff, to designate what deputies he will, to keep the Sabbat
			  out of our city. If he asks for your help, give it.
			  Now, enjoy the rest of the evening."
		-At that, Tony Perez called out, saying that drinks are free for the rest of the night, and
		 music began.
		-Sitting back down at my table, I recieved reserved Ventrue congratulations, then the rest
		 of the clan slowly trickled out.
		-Garett them approached me, asking me to follow him, handing me a set of keys: "These are
		 the master keys for 13th floor of the Lancaster building in Hell's Kitchen. A presence
		 there is needed at all times. See to it. I was told you could be entrusted in this. Your
		 sire spoke highly of you. Officially, Mr. Wright's name is on the lease (the Ventrue
		 Primogen). If you need anything, or something happens. Call me. Also, I'm deputizing you.
		 You do not want to let me down."
		-He then went off to speak with Mr. Nightwalker, followed by a brief exchange with Mr. Nier,
		 Garett grimacing through the whole thing with the latter.
		-While Garett talked with Mr. Nier, I talked to Cadusis, remarking that we'd made each
		 other's acquaintence again sooner than I'd anticipated.
			-I also asked about this clanmate of his, whose job we'd be taking over. Did he know her?
			-He briefly indicated yes, but said that we shouldn't talk of the matter here.
		-Mr. Nier then approached the two of us.
			-"Here," he said to me, "Have my card."
			 He pulled something from his lapel, handing it to me. I took it reflexively, only to
			 look in horror at the gray beard hair he had handed me."
			-Noticing my reaction, he babbled something about many cultures respecting the wisdom in
			 the beards of the aged.
			 "Is that any area of interest to you, then?" I asked, ". . . Anthropology?"
			 "Yes, yes. I have connections in many of the city's universities, and a diverse set of
			  esoteric interests. . ."
		-As we talked, a woman named Kelly Haley called to us, and asked for a favor.
			-"I was asked to get a couple boxes from a storage unit here in town, but, um, the guy
			  won't let me into the unit. I. . . get really angry, when he talks to me like that. . ."
			 "We would be happy to help," I responded, "We wouldn't want there to be a scene. . ."
			-The others chimed in, responding affirmatively.
			-"The storage unit is near Times Square, in a really tall building fronted with black glass."
			 Mr. Nightwalker: "What's in these boxes?"
			 "I don't know."
			 Mr. Nightwalker: "How do we recognize them, then?"
			 ". . . It's the boxes. The boxes in the storage unit?"
			-Mr. Nightwalker then took out a notepad and asked her a number of detailed questions,
			 but without much luck. Best he got was, "I don't know. It tastes like. . . mustard?"
				-Turning to Mr. Nier, she said, "You know what I'm talking about, right?"
					-I suspect they're clanmates.
	-We then discussed our next move.
		-Elysium is in midtown, the Lancaster building in Hell's Kitchen, and the storage unit in
		 Times Square.
		-Misters Nier and Nightwalker were interested in checking out the storage unit first, but I
		 argued the Sheriff would not look kindly upon delay. Unless they knew the building already,
		 it would be best to work on that in parallel.
		-We settled on heading straight to the Lancaster building. I said I'll have a car brought
		 around, though Mr. Nier said he had one as well.
		-I then headed outside, pulled out a phone and reinserted it's battery, and then called Mr.
		 Hubbard, to have him bring the car around.
		-Mr. Nightwalker arrived as I was still on the phone, and protested that we could take his
		 car, but I said my staff would be joining us as well, and that we'd follow him.
	-Arriving at the Lancaster, we headed up to the 13th floor, finding a whole floor of empty
	 apartments, with the key I was given opening apparently every door.
		-As we entered, I asked Mr. Hubbard to give the place a once over, see what we're dealing
		 with. Mr. Nightwalker joined him in that.
		-After some time, the two of them completed the sweep.
			-Each of the modest apartments was identical in floorplan, empty aside from basic
			 furnishings.
			-In each, the table held a set of keys opening only the apartment's own door, as well
			 as some paperwork, listing the aparment's contents and asking any staying there to
			 sign the document.
			-The apartments lack windows, and the floor has only one entrance, the elevator at the
			 North end of the hall. No fire escapes or stairs or in evidence.
				-The elevator had needed a key to reach the 13th floor, too.
				-Concrete floors and ceilings too, beneath whatever coverings.
				-This place was clearly modified for the purposes of our kind. . .
		-Mr. Nightwalker also brought up that we're not far from Smith's Bar, an establishment run
		 by his ally, a Brujah called Mason, and that his haven was upstairs there.
			-Mr. Nier also volunteered that he has a haven "part of which can survive a nuclear blast."
				-"Oh? And where is this place?" I asked.
				 "Perhaps you've heard of Mega Beans? It's a coffeshop?"
				-I also asked him a bit about himself, what our esteemed prince expected him to contribute.
					-"My charm, I suppose? Some warmth. Also my. . . insights into the coming events."
					 "Coming events?"
					 "Well, I'm concerned about our security for a reason. . ."
					-Bit of a paranoid, sounds like. I can work with that, though.
		-I asked Ms. Veck to, over the next day, run a quick property search, and pull related
		 documents: "This place is supposed to be in Mr. Wright's name, so I'm sure it's all in
		 order, but it's best to be sure."
		-Mr. Nightwalker offered to arrange the delivery of supplies discretely, a useful capability.
		-Mr. Nier also babeled a bit about supplies he had for "the coming day when all this paper
		 in our wallets becomes useless."
	-Mr. Nier then left for his haven, with us all agreeing we'd meet back here at nightfall.
	-Mr. Nightwalker retrieved some supplies from his car, flashbangs, tear gas, and masks for the
	 ghouls.
		-There was a laptop as well, one the he claimed was carefully secured, mentioning a
		 "Schreknet", and routing through his haven.
		-I referred him to Mr. Horton where the weapons were concerned, and the two of them
		 conferred, discussing how to deploy them.
		-He also gave me another card, different from the first, for a "House of Sinatrix", a fetish
		 dungeon. He said that was his haven nearby, and where his laptop routed through.
	-Waking the next night, my retainers reported no incidents, nor messages requiring my urgent
	 attention.
		-Waking being Mr. Horton and Mr. Hubbard's shift change, I took the opportunity to ask Mr.
         Horton to see to the place's security.
			-He mentioned installing both cameras and reinforced doors. I made sure to insist the
			 cameras be on an airgapped network, with encrypted local storage.
			-I also claimed the apartment in the NE corner of the building for myself.
		-I then spoke with Ms. Veck, asking her to search out the black glass building Ms. Haley had
		 mentioned.
			-In short order, she had found one candidate, a highrise matching the description with
			 a warehouse in the building.
			-That warehouse storage area is owned by "Panacea Pharmaceuticals".
	-Mr. Nier soon returned too.
		-He requested a moment of my time, describing a cop poking around "his" coffee shop, looking
		 for a missing person.
		-I asked him if he "knew anything" about the disappearance himself, which he claimed not to,
		 but he still did not want the attention.
		-Talking to him further, he claimed to possess talents that would allow him to manipulate
		 the officers memories, to send him off the trail, and just needed to get some time alone
		 with him.
		-I helped him strategize an approach for doing that, setting up and interview at the coffee
		 shop, posing as an employee who may have seen something.
			-You resisted getting personally invovled, though, still unsure of Mr. Nier and not
			 wanting to entangle yourself with a disappearance.
	-Mr. Nightwalker ran some errands, but, on his return, he reported running into some new Kindred
	 in the city.
		-Middle Easterners, they made their presence known at Mason's bar, and were asking about the
		 Tremere.
	-I also took this opportunity to ask Mr. Nightwalker about Effie May.
		-Turns out she's his sire, but he doesn't know why she has left the city.
		-She was always erratic, though, which is why much of his education came from Mason.
		-"What was she to Mason?" I then asked.
		 "Let's say they had a. . . working relationship. The sheriff now says I'm even deader if I
		  try to leave too."
	-We then decided to do some research into Panacea Pharmaceuticals.
		-It's a subsidiary of another company, Mastodon, also pharmaceutical focused.
		-We did find a contact number, though.
	-We ultimately decided to pose as OSHA inspectors. Ms. Veck through together some forged
	 paperwork, and made the call.
		-We got something set up, but we were still rather unsure of how we'd identify the package
		 in question.
			-Ms. Haley had seemed to be confident Mr. Nier could identify it, but he seemed only
			 somewhat confident.
			-So, he ran off to Mr. Nightwalker's car, to "think" on it.
			-By the time we came to join him, we found him rocking in the back seat, having chewed
			 all of his fingernails off.
	-We drove to the building, and Ms. Veck talked our way inside.
		-We got an escorted tour of the facility, while a concealed Mr. Nier trailed along, looking
		 for our goal.
		-Eventually he sent me a text, indicating a nearby door. We asked our escort to open it, and
		 Mr. Nier was soon back in the car with the box. We found him reading a notebook he'd pulled
		 from it as we returned there ourselves.
		-We then delivered it to Ms. Haley, meeting her again at Elysium, who's now indebted to the three
		 of us for a minor boon.
	-I also took a moment to reach out to Sheriff Hawthorn, alerting him to the strangers in town.
		-He was apparently aware of them, though, as they'd properly alerted the Prince to their
		 presence.


2/16/22:
	-Shortly after I rose the next night, I received a text message, inviting me to a salon at the
	 Cooper Union, tonight at 12:00.
		-The Cooper Union for the Advancement of the Sciences and Arts is a prestigious art school
		 near the East Village.
		-I didn't recognize the number, but I certainly recognized an opportunity.
	-I made arrangements with Mr. Hubbard to keep an eye on the emergency haven, and letting him know
	 I'll be busy for the evening. I also asked Ms. Veck to come along with me.
	-In the process of that all, I also received a text from Mr. Nightwalker, asking if I had also
	 been invited to the salon. (Of course I was!)
		-He offered a ride, but, being only a short walk away in the Village, I let him know I was
		 already nearby.
	-Arriving at the school, there were a few off duty cops out front, acting as security.
		-Other kindred were trickling in, including many I recognized from Elysium, and Mr.
		 Nightwalker.
		-We greeted each other, and I reassured him that our new haven was under careful watch.
		-He also asked me if I knew what this was all about, to which I responded, "Seeing and being
		 seen. Many of our kindred will be here."
		-While we waited, Mr. Nightwalker and I also made the acquaintence of Ms. Gravel, doing
		 introductions, and later of Ms. Arnautovic.
		-Following that, a clanmate pulled me aside, Mr. Arkan. Quietly, he told me that the board
		 had been "unable to get me out of last night's declaration", and that some of these other
		 "riff raff" would soon be joining our coterie as well.
			-Maybe not quite quietly enough, as Ms. Anautovic apologized after I returned to the
			 group, for having to associate with "riff raff" like herself.
			-I tried to reassure her that not all of us get to move in such rarified air as Mr.
			 Arkan.
	-We were eventually ushered inside by one of the (noteably glassy-eyed) cops.
		-Inside, we recognized a few faces.
		-One we didn't, a man, pulled out a Sharpie, and wrote "Ew" on his forehead, while someone
		 next to him wrote "Edward" on his own.
			-They were saying something about the "talent" being there, and needing a "$5,000 deposit",
			 which the other providing it by writing "$5,000" and "check" on a post-it, handing it
			 to him.
			-Ew fell to the gournd, then, and Edward walked over to another woman, who wrote
			 something on her own forehead, and then pretended to be a telephone before falling over.
			-This went on for some time with the three of them, beeping, falling down, and talking
			 into invisible telephones.
				-One Edward Van Buren was mentioned during the "telephone" conversations.
			-A fourth joined their routine, and, at the end of it, all bowed, then shook their heads,
			 looking confused.
			-Kip DuBuque, a Nosfertu of Ms. Gravel's acquaintence commented that the display must
			 have been "the show the harpy had planned."
	-After the show, Ms. D'Franco, the Seneschal came out from an interior room, and requested the
	 presences of the three women of our recent acquaintence.
		-Behind her, I could see a couple of the Primogen, those of Clans Nosferatu and Tremere, and
		 heard still more voices.
		-They joined Ms. D'Franco inside for 5 minutes or so.
		-After they emerged, Ms. Felicity walked off with some speed, but I caught Ms. Gravel and Ms.
		 Arnautovic, remarking, "My aren't we popular tonight!"
		 Ms. Gravel: "Unfortunately"
		 Me: "Oh? Bad news?"
		 Ms. Arnautovic: "Apparently we are now neonates, fledglings no more."
		 Me: "Then a cause for celebration, it would seem!"
	-Sheriff Hawthorn then approached us.
		-"The harpy's show aside, Van Buren was attacked tonight."
		 "Oh?" I responded, "Well before the show? More recently?"
		 "Dunno. I want the lot of you to look into it."
			-Ms. Gravel rolled her eyes at the mention of the name.
		-Turning to Ms. Anautovic, he said "Change of plans. Mr. Nielsen will be looking after you
		 tonight instead of me."
		-He then deputized me again, somewhat sarcastically with a mock knighting gesture with his
		 arm (acknowledged gravely by Mr. Nielsen), carefully clarifying this time, though, that
         it was "for this night only."
		-He also added, "Oh, and, if you see Sam, kick him in the ass for me. He should have been
		 here."
		-He then turned to go, but I followed, asking if he had any information about Mr. Van Buren's
		 last known location, or the location of the attack.
			-In the corner of the room, Siobhan spoke up, saying, "Eddy is dying. Cobwebs are falling
			 out of him ."
			 Hawthorn: "Real helpful, Siobhan. My men say he was last seen South of Alphabet City.
	-Ms. Anautovic then asked Mr. Nightwalker if he knew this Van Buren.
		-He shook his head, but, having noted Ms. Gravel's reaction earlier, I turned and asked her
		 if _she_ did.
		 "He's a tool," she replied.
		 "I suppose that won't make our task any more pleasant, then."
	-Ms. Gravel stepped into another room for a bit, and, meanwhile, Ms. Anautovic boasted of some
	 talents where finding people is concerned.
		-Welcome news, with Mr. Nightwalker also having some talents in the area, given what we need
		 to do.
	-After Ms. Gravel returned, we arranged transport, loading into Mr. Nightwalker and my cars.
		-During that, Ms. Gravel also asked us all what sort of things we're into.
			-Mr. Nightwalker described his bailbonds business.
			-I chimed in saying, "Software, mostly. Technology in general."
				-Turning to Ms. Arnautovic, "I also have an arrangement with your clanmates, to
				 operate a blood testing firm."
			-Ms. Felicity responded that she's a dancer. "Burlesque, some stripping."
			-She herself teaches online classes. What kind? "Pathology, of various sorts. . ."
	-Ms. Gravel also mentioned that Mr. Van Buren has a gambling problem, and may have people after
	 him for money.
	-Mr. Nightwalker drove off with Ms. Gravel and Ms. Arnautovic, as I called Ms. Veck to bring my
	 own car around.
		-While we waited, Mr. Nier ran up, at a full sprint.
		 "Running late, Mr. Nier?" I asked. "The sheriff was asking about you."
		 "I had some things to take care of. Thought the world was ending."
		 "Well, next time you think that may be so, please do let me know. I'd appreciate the. . .
		  warning."
		-I then introduced him to Ms. Arnautovic, and he inquired about what happened at the party.
			-I let him know about the new job.
	-The three of us then loaded into my car, once Ms. Veck arrived with it, and we drove towards
	 Alphabet City.
		-Mr. Nier asked her to step on it if she sees any birds. . .
		-On the way, though, we got a message from Mr. Nightwalker, with a new address Ms. Gravel
		 provided, in Queens.
		-As we arrived, I could see Mr. Nightwalker's car down the street, and Ms. Gravel standing
		 in front of the address.
		-She led us inside, Mr. Nier still raving about birds, while Ms. Veck kept the car running.
			-Inside, a man, presumably Van Buren, suffering from a shotgun wound.
			-Ms. Gravel had gone to fetch a bag of blood from Mr. Nightwalker's trunk, but was not
			 yet giving it to him, asking him instead about what happened to him.
			-He began to tell us about having been attacked by inquisitors. . .
			-Mr. Nier interrupted, though, by causing a scene with a .38, raving about Mr. Van Buren
			 being a "giant leech" and "eating his own tail".
			-We calmed him, though, assuring him we'd "contain" the "leech".
			-Mr. Nightwalker turned to me, asking what we should do with him, but, Ms. Arnautovic
			 spoke first, saying, "Please, allow me."
			 "Be my guest."
			-She dug around in her bag, pulling out as purple gemstone. She moved it over him, while
			 making hand symbols with her other hand, then saying, "He's lying."
			 "Wait! Wait! You don't need to. . . steal my soul or whatever. I needed to repay my,
			 debt but couldn't, so he shot me."
			-He didn't seem to be lying about _that_. Instead, he seemed scared, scared that we
			 found this out.
			-Sam walked off raving about the paintings.
			-"For this," I asked, "You want to stay at the haven? This _personal_ mess?"
			 "Hell no," Mr. Nightwalker chimed in.
			 "Also, you said this bookie shot you? Did he see you walk away? We may have a breach
			 here," Ms. Arnautovic pointed out.
			 "Look, I'll deal with it! If you just give me some blood, I'll take care of it!" Mr.
			 Van Buren pleaded.
			 "Not happening," Mr. Nightwalker said, "Who is this bookie?"
			 "I'll deal with! Just give me the blood!"
			 "No way," said Mr. Nightwalker again, "You've already fucked it up once."
			-At this, Mr. Van Buren stepped toward Mr. Nightwalker, baring his fangs.
			-"You do not want to disappoint us, Mr. Van Buren!" I snarled, with the force of my
			 presence behind it.
			-His face changed to a look of terror in response, and he fell to the ground, weeping.
			-Nonetheless, Mr. Nier decided he still needed to unload his .38 into the crowd of us,
			 winging Ms. Arnautovic.
			-Mr. Nightwalker proved more prudent, though, tasering the weeping Mr. Van Buren.
				-After Van Buren twitched for a bit, Mr. Nightwalker told him, "Stay down, or I'm
				 tazing you again."
				-He groanded, and seemed incapable of _not_ complying.
			-Ms. Gravel then asked her associate, Ms. Aryel Hill, if there were any zip ties around,
			 and she returned with some very suitable metal ones.
			-While they bound him, I reprimanded Mr. Nier, saying, "I want to remind you, Mr. Nier,
			 that, no matter what someone may look like, if the blood of our kindred runs through
			 their veins, do not end their lives imprudently."
				-In response, he maligned our new coterie members, asking how we knew they weren't
				 owls. . .
					-"By checking for feathers, Mr. Nier."
			-As I turned back to the rest of the coterie, shaking my head, I saw Ms. Anautovic wipe
			 a bloody tear from Mr. Van Buren's face, and then lick it from her finger.
			-Then, pulling the whimpering man upright, she said that, if he does not give us the name
			 of his bookie, he will be staked, and delivered to the sheriff. She also said that she
			 had taken a vial of his blood, and that, if he did not comply with us, she would curse
			 him terribly. This began the whimpering and tears again.
			-Ms. Gravel's "roommate", as she described her, was getting a bit testy, though, and we
			 decided to head back to the "crash" haven.
			-Mr. Nightwalker then ran out to his car, returning with a body bag and a sheriff's badge
			 on his chest. He loaded Mr. Van Buren into the bag, along with some added hand cuffs,
			 and I helped him get the whole thing into the trunk of his car.
			-On our way out, I begged the pardon of Ms. Hill, asking that she forgive our intrusion.
	-We loaded back into both cars, and headed back to the haven with Mr. Van Buren.
		-On the ride back, the radio was reporting breaking news concerning a rash of kidnappings
		 across the city. The mayor's daughter was apparently taken.
		-Another station was talking about a cult out on Staten Island, The Brotherhood of the Second
		 Dawn.
			-We'd all heard the name. They're associated with an "angel" sighting on Staten Island,
			 who had swooped down to rescue someone who had jumped off a building, then flying off.
			-The cult believes the end of the world is coming (of course).
	-We road the elevator up, introduced the new folks to Mr. Hubbard, and then dumped Mr. Van Buren
	 in one of the apartments.
		-Mr. Nightwalker, with Ms. Gravel's help, went to return his gear to his car.
		-Ms. Arnautovic, Ms. Felicity, and I, accompanied by Mr. Hubbard and with Mr. Nier trailing behind, went
		 to go interrogate Mr. Van Buren.
			-The bookie is named Sergio, and he operates out of Hell's Kitchen.
			-Mr. Van Buren apparently owes him $70,000.
			-"What were you betting on, sugar?" Ms. Felicity asked.
			 "Dog fighting, if you must know."
			-"Where did this fight happen?" Ms. Arnautovic asked.
			 "It was on the street. . . A homeless guy there might have seen too. I was stabbed
			 several times, then the shotgun. . . I tripped over a trash can, then ran straight to Gravel's apartment
			-"One more thing, hon," Felicity said, "This Sergio, does he have body guards? Muscle?"
			 "Well. . . he drinks, and when he does, he likes to drink alone. A place called Smith's
			 Bar, in Hell's Kitchen. Talks to some Arabic guy there. Might be the best place. . ."
				-Ah, the place Mr. Nightwalker's ally, Mason, runs.
			-Ms. Arnautovic then asked Mr. Van Buren for a description of Sergio, which he was able
			 to provide with solid detail.
	-Mr. Nightwalker and Ms. Gravel then returned, so we left Mr. Van Buren in Mr. Hubbard's care,
	 while we talked over our next move.
		-After relaying what we'd learned, Mr. Nightwalker even recognized Sergio.
		-I suggested to Mr. Nightwalker that we speak with his friend Mason before doing anything
		 in his establishment, and he vehemetly agreed.
			-He also added some stern words for Mr. Nier, who talked of sneaking in.
		-I also discussed the fact that I _could_ pay off Mr. Van Buren's debts, but didn't get the
		 impression that Mr. Van Buren was a worthwhile investment.
			-Ms. Gravel didn't do much to reassure me on that score, though she also didn't seem to
			 want him _dead_.
			-Ms. Arnautovic raised the very good point of her blood curse threat, which could go a
			 long ways towards rendering him a bit more trustworthy.
	-Ms. Gravel then left to find some dinner, and Mr. Nightwalker ducked into one of the apartments,
	 to call Mason.
	-While he was still on the phone, Mr. Hubbard emerged from the apartment, staggering a bit.
	 "Where is Mr. Van Buren?!?" I asked.
	 "He's fine. . . just needed a drink. . ."
	-I rushed into the apartment, to see a still-bound Mr. Van Buren wiping blood from his face with
	 his shoulder, saying as I entered, "Ah, that's better."
	 "Though we've been neglectful hosts," I said, frostily, "Ask if you need a drink."
		-Yeah, fuck this guy.
	-There was then some commotion out in the hall, as Mr. Nightwalker called all of us back over.
		-Apparently Mr. Mason and this Sergio are close, which may resolve that aspect of the
		 Masquerade violation, but add other complications.
		-Those complications are coming quick, as Mason is apparently heading over here, _with_
		 Mr. Sergio, to talk this over.
	-We set Ms. Arnautovic to watch over Mr. Van Buren, and she asked him more about this homeless
	 man.


3/2/22:
	-Mr. Nightwalker arranged for us to meet Misters Mason and Sergio on the building's roof, with
	 Ms. Arnautovic remaining behind to keep an eye on Mr. Van Buren.
	-They arrived a short while later, Mr. Sergio with a .45 tucked into his belt and Mr. Mason
	 with a chain and padlock hanging from his neck.
		-Mr. Nightwalker described the issue to Mr. Mason, and introduced him to me.
		-I openly offered Mr. Van Buren to him, explaining that my concern here was the Masquerade.
		-Mr. Mason, though, didn't want to jepordize his relations with the other Toreador.
			-He was in favor of delivering Mr. Van Buren to the sheriff, but wanted Mr. Sergio kept
			 out of it. Mr. Van Buren had violated Mr. Mason's domain too, here, _attacking_ (they
			 said) his retainer. Not pursuing the matter would be an embarassment, but pursuing it
			 would jeopordize alliances with various Toreador.
			-That leaves us unclear on what story to tell the sheriff, but the sheriff seemed like
			 he wanted assurances more than details.
		-We agreed, but wanted to ask Mr. Sergio about the details of the incident.
		    -He confirmed that a homeless man saw the shot.
			-Ms. Gravel asked him where the incident occurred, and he told us it was outside the
			 Siamese Room, by the trash can alongside the building.
		-Mr. Mason then pointed off to the East, saying the sun would soon rise, and requested that
		 he be allowed to stay here for the day.
			-"It's the safehouse, right?"
			-We assented, but I made am excuse ("security") to head down first, to warn Mr. Van
			 Buren to keep quiet.
	-They spent the day here uneventfully, and left in the evening.
		-On the way out, Mr. Mason revealed a somewhat more contemptuous relationship with his
		 retainers, as he roughly fed from Mr. Sergio and then dragged him to the elevator.
	-The next order of business, we decided, was to see about this witness.
		-With some threats from Ms. Arnautovic, we insisted Mr. Van Buren stay put, though Mr.
		 Nightwalker and I also kept watch over him while the others hunted.
			-I simply had Ms. Veck fetch me some bags of blood from Energence, furnished by my
			 herd.
		-During that watch, though, I soon heard shouting out in the hall, and Mr. Hubbard calling
		 for my attention while pointing at the security monitor window on his laptop.
			-I ran out to the hall, where a now-clawed Mr. Nightwalker was stepping towards Mr. Van
			 Buren while Van Buren called my name, saying Nightwalker was attacking him!
			-I was already long since sick of his shit, though, and wasted not a moment to bare my
			 fangs, shouting at him, "Why are you out of your room?!?" with the full force of my
			 presence behind it.
			-He did much the same, focusing his gaze on Mr. Nightwalker but to no effect, as he took
			 a narrowly dodged swipe at Mr. Van Buren.
			-Mr. Van Buren was no more afraid of me, but, after redoubling the force of my gaze, he
			 did indeed flee into the room, slamming the door behind himself.
	-The rest of the coterie slowly trickled in, witnessing the tense scene of us standing, armed,
	 clawed, or whatever, outside the apartment door.
		-We then had a heated debate about Mr. Van Buren's fate, but with no real conclusion.
		-Ms. Arnautovic was most inclined to mercy, and asked that she be allowed to talk to him
		 again.
			-Mr. Nier concealed himself and accompanied her, into the apartment.
		-She came out saying that he was claiming Mr. Nightwalker's attack was unprovoked, and that
		 he intended to sing that song to the sheriff, citing the video recording.
		-We reviewed it, and it did indeed support Van Buren's story, though, as I pointed out, many
		 powers of the blood can go unseen on video.
		-At that, Ms. Arnautovic suddenly began asking if there was time for her to visit her clan's
		 "chantry". Perhaps she has some means of detecting such things?
		-We agreed she did have time, and agreed it was time to stake Mr. Van Buren.
	-Ms. Gravel, Mr. Nightwalker, and an invisible Mr. Nier all entered the apartment to accomplish
	 said staking, with Mr. Hubbard and I waiting in the hall.
	-They came back out, Mr. Nightwalker and Ms. Gravel now arguing with each other, though Mr.
	 Nightwalker said the deed was done.
	-That so, I suggested we see to our witness, as I did not want to present the matter to the
	 sheriff with loose ends.
		-Ms. Gravel, oddly, suggested bringing Mr. Van Buren along, to identify him.
			-I thought we'd all agreed we'd had enough of his shit?
		-All agreed we should deal with it as fast as possible, though, so we loaded into Mr.
		 Nightwalker's and my cars.
		-Pulling up out front, the neon-covered massage parlor was in a decidedly shady corner of
		 town, though there was quite a bit of foot traffic.
		-Sam spotted a dumpster nearby with a bunch of bullet holes, presumably the scene of our
		 incident.
		-Stepping into the alley, there was a man sitting against one wall.
		-Approaching him, we could see he'd tied off one arm with a belt, and had a needle
		 embedded in it.
		-Ms. Felicity approached him, asking him if he was alright, but received only a some
		 mumbling and a slow attempt to swat her hand away in response.
		-Jostling him a bit further, he became a bit more alert, mumbling something about
		 needing something to drink.
		-Ms. Felicity ask him if he had any water or the like, and he responded, ". . . my bag."
		-Opening it, she found the water, a panhandling sign with damage from buckshot (our man!),
		 and a wallet far too nice for him.
			-Mr. Nier grabbed at the last, and, opening it, it proved to be Mr. Van Buren's,
			 still containing several hundred dollars.
		-Mr. Nightwalker then pushed in, removing the belt from the man's arm, saying something
		 about how he could be hemorrhaging.
		-After removing the belt, though, the man slumped further, and Mr. Nightwalker began to
		 call an ambulance.
		-The rest of us got the hell out of the alley, though I grabbed the man's bag as I did so.
		-Mr. Nightwalker called after us, though, shouting, "Sam, keep an eye on Gravel! Don't
		 let her leave."
		-We all turned to look at her after that, but she was already gone.
		-"What the hell are you talking about?" I asked.
		 "When we went to see to Van Buren," Mr. Nightwalker called back, "She started making out
		  with him. I think she might try to free him. . ."
		-I recognized the signs of entrancement, a feat I can manage myself when necessary.
		-I quickly explained my hypothesis to the others, then made a couple of phone calls.
			-First, to Mr. Hubbard, asking him to lock the haven elevator until he heard from me
			 and warning him that Ms. Gravel is not to be trusted right now.
			-Second, to Ms. Veck, who I asked to bring my car around.
				-Mr. Nightwalker said he would remain here, waiting for the ambulance.
		-As we loaded into the cars, we could hear sirens approaching.
			-Rather than an ambulence, though, a man on a motorcycle with a chainsaw zoomed past,
			 followed be several cop cars, from which the police were firing at him.
			-"What was that?" Mr. Nier.
			 "Seems the city is going to hell," I replied.
			-Or maybe elsewhere? As he rode off, for a moment, the man on the motorcycle seemed to
			 briefly have white wings. . .
	-After that, though, we indeed headed to the haven.
		-On the way, though, I recieved a call from Mr. Hubbard, saying that. . . something that
		 looked like me had just entered the haven, and then he'd lost track of it.
		 "What?!? Why did you open the elevator without me contacting you?!?"
		 "I didn't. . ."
		 ". . . just lock the place down, as best you can."
		-Once there, I went to go check with Mr. Hubbard, to see if he'd seen more of our intruder,
		 while the rest rushed to check on Mr. Van Buren.
		-Mr. Hubbard hadn't seen anything further, and Mr. Nier emerged from the far apartment
		 carrying Mr. Van Buren.
		-He was still staked, but now had bruises around his head.
		-They wanted to take him to the sheriff as quickly as possible.
		-I had reservations about the situation still being a mess, so I said, "Wait! First, we
		 should review the camera footage."
			-What we saw was part of the hallway's wall bulging and breaking, spilling pink foam,
			 from which _I_ emerged, or at least something wearing my face.
			-This figure, presumably Ms. Gravel walked down the hall, where Mr. Hubbard ran out,
			 asking _me_ how I got in.
			 ". . . they let me in."
			 ". . . Stop wearing that face."
			 "I'm. . . I'm going to go check on Van Buren. . ." she said, as she ran towards the
			 apartment, and he pulled out his phone.
		-As we finished that, I heard a "Sorry about that." Turning, I saw _me_, presumably Ms.
		 Gravel, standing next to us.
		-At that, we all stared for a moment, and then Mr. Nier and Ms. Arnautovic renewed their
		 push to contact the sheriff.
		-I expressed discomfort at dumping this in his lap with so many loose ends. "First," I
		 said, "Let me call Mr. Nightwalker, since he's in charge of our biggest loose end.
		-Calling him, he told me he had the man taken to the hospital by a friend of his, and that
		 he was going home.
			-I was understandably furious. "What?!? You mean you're not with him? Our goal was to
			 silence the man!"
			 "I wasn't going to kill him! I guess I could ask my friend to. . . But he was
			  overdosing. . ."
			 "I'm not asking you to kill him! But we needed to talk to him, make sure he isn't
			  telling stories. . . Get the address of the hospital you took him to!"
			 "OK, OK. I'll find out. Call me if you need more. . ."
		-I let the others know  and we argued further about whether we were ready to contact the,
		 sheriff.
			-Mr. Nier volunteered to follow up with the man in the hospital.
			-Ms. Arnautovic volunteered her charm, _confident_ she could sway the sheriff and
			 protect our interests.
				-When asked, she would admit to no particular hold on him, but, still, I wonder,
				 given how he said, when first she and I met, that I'd be looking after her instead
				 of _him_, due to some change in plans. . .
			-I eventually agreed to it, and of course was the only one with the means to contact
			 him, so it's still very much my head in the noose.
			-As such, I called the sheriff and, getting voicemail, left a message saying I had the
			 man he was interested in hand, and that we should meet to discuss our next move.
			-Two minutes later, I received a text saying he'd meet us at the haven.
	-The sheriff arrived a short while later.
		-Ms. Arnautovic did most of the talking, explaining that Mr. Van Buren's poor judgement had
		 resulted in a Masquerade violation, but that we had the loose covered and wanted to turn
		 Mr. Van Buren over to him.
		-He agreed, but seemed distracted. He said something about it being a weird night, speculating
		 it was "something in the water, maybe. . ."
		-He then unceremoniously put Mr. Van Buren in a trash bag, and took him with as he left.
	-With the rest of the night, those of us at the haven saw to repairing the wall that Ms. Gravel
	 had destroyed.
		-Turned out she'd broken in through one of the covered-over windows. We have to see to
		 reinforcing those better.
	-The next evening, we all woke up to news reports of a gunfight, starting in Times Square and
	 running to the Bronx, during which an "angel" intervened to save a kid.
		-They had a picture of the "angel", a hispanic man standing in front of a child, who
		 noteably did _not_ look like the man we saw on a motorcycle ourselves. . .
		-Ms. Gravel also contacted all of us to let us know that, 15 minutes before sunrise this
		 morning, she felt her entrancement brake.
			-_Probably_ a sign things turned out well for us there. . .


3/16/22:
	-It has been a couple of weeks. . .
		-Over that time, the "angels" have remained in the news, though coverage quickly began to
		 include mention of a movie that was being filmed, with participation from the NYPD, and
		 claims that they were using blanks.
		-In private conversations, though, many of my acquaintances talked about how this was
		 clearly a clumsy cover up of the Masquerade violation, and rumors swirled that the prince
		 would be calling a blood hunt for these "angels".
		-There have also been a lot of fights breaking out over the city. Usually occurring among
		 the lower rungs of society, large brawls have been erupting and, when broken up by the
		 cops, the participants often profess to not know what was going on.
			-Siobhan, the Malkavian harpy, claims these people are fairies, and warns that these
			 brawls could prove very dangerous, and should be avoided.
		-There have also been werewolf sightings on the edge of the city, and the prince eventually
		 responded by forbidding Kindred from leaving the city, hoping to avoid provoking an
		 incident.
		-The clans:
			-The Nosferatu seem to be greatly concerned by all this, worried. . . something is trying
			 to stir something up.
			-The Malkavians, meanwhile, have been oddly quiet amidst the chaos, seeming distant.
			-The Tremere too have been similarly distant, with their leadership remote from even
			 the clan's own rank and file.
			-Many Ventrue and Toreador have busied themselves keeping the angel thing under wraps,
			 deploying media teams or hosting events tied to the supposed movie.
			-The Brujah are quiet about why, but many are behaving like they're gearing up for war.
		-I spent the time tending to my personal affairs, including diving ever deeper into the
		 minds of my herd (I trained Dominate 2).
	-Mr. Nightwalker let us know that Ms. Cat, the caitiff with the missing friend had contacted him,
	 asking to meet, forwarding us her text.
		-I agreed that we'd offered her our help, and referred him to Ms. Veck to schedule the
		 matter.
	-Ms. Gravel later reached out with a text of her own, saying she'd uncovered something important,
	 and wished to meet in person, probably at the haven.
		-She too was referred to Ms. Veck, to get it set up.
	-We met at the safe haven, early on Wednesday evening.
		-Ms. Gravel said that she'd uncovered some information while researching the "angels".
		-Her. . . roommate had some form of vision, and Ms. Gravel showed us a picture of a painting
		 the roommate had made of it.
		-It showed a near-skeletal figure, tendrils reaching up for him from beneath the ground as
		 beams of light shown down from above.
		-Along with this, Ms. Gravel showed us some notes too, things her roommate had said while in
		 some kind of trance.
			-Some of which she pointed out were excerpts of "Noddist texts", some Kindred
			 superstition.
			-Well, Ms. Arnautovic pointed out it was a slightly different account from that in the
			 "Book of Nod", being instead from the perspective of Lillith.
			-The other portion of what her roommate recited matched something called "Days of Fire",
			 the work of some madman who led a suicide cult back in the 90's.
		-I asked Ms. Gravel what made her think this. . . vision was tied to the "angels", aside
		 from the general apocalyptic overtones of both, and she responded it would be quite the
		 coincidence otherwise.
			-So, timing, basically.
		-Ms. Arnautovic treated the matter gravely, and Mr. Nier was of course certain that the end
		 must surely _now_ be nigh, but Ms. Felicity and I seemed to both have our doubts. . .
	-A few hours later, we were due to meet Ms. Cat at Elysium.
		-She and her prick friend from our first meeting, who she referred to as "B. O. B." as they
		 spoke, walked up right around when we did, meeting us outside the club.
		-He waited a short distance back as she approached us, seemingly still in quite a state,
		 holding back tears.
		-She said that her friend Larry was dead, found in his car after visiting his family.
			-The family believed he'd overdosed, but Ms. Cat pointed out that was impossible (of
			 course) since his embrace: "He couldn't get high anymore. We watched him try."
		-That was a few months back, and another friend, Tammy, had died recently, staked to a light
		 pole on one of Coney Island's beaches and left for the sun.
		-"Someone is killing my friends, and no one cares. They say we're barely kindred anyways. . ."
		-Misses Gravel and Arnautovic asked many questions about the victims.
			-Larry seemed to be a junkie, alive mostly because Ms. Cat and her friends looked after
			 him.
			-Tammy, meanwhile, thought she could fit in with other Kindred, despite her clanlessness,
			 and tried hard to.
				-Elaborating later, she mentioned Jose Perez, a Toreador and the Keeper of Elysium,
				 who Ms. Cat claims was stringing Tammy along, as she attempted to fit in.
		-"B.O.B" then broke in, with his usual aplomb, saying that Ms. Cat also thinks something is
		 watching her, starting before Larry and Tammy were killed, and told her to show us the
		 bite on her head.
			-She grudgingly obliged, showing scabbed over wounds (another sign of her high
			 generation?) on her scalp, which she said she woke up with. . .
			-Ms. Gravel examined the wounds, pronouncing them the work of an unusually large rat.
			-I asked Ms. Cat where she lays her head. Would such creatures be. . . expected there?
			-No, she claimed, and B.O.B added that this had happened to her multiple times over the
			 past couple months, even once while she had been staying with him.
		-We also got the address of Larry's family, and the place of Tammy's death.
		-Ms. Cat then broached the matter of payment, saying they'd of course try to pay us back later,
		 but said that, "We don't want to give you any more of our blood."
			-Uh, what?
			-Questioned, she appeared to be reluctant to speak of the matter, but Ms. Arnautovic
			 and I persuaded her.
			-She said that one of the Ventrue, Elitha Schmidt, was buying their blood, but had
			 sworn them to secrecy, even making them sign something.
				-I know her as one of the older members of the board in NYC, with her domains being
				 focused on the legal system.
			-Their friend Layla was apparently supposed to be Elitha's childer, but something went
			 wrong during the embrace, and she's no Ventrue. . .
				-A matter of no small embarassment for Elitha.
		-Ms. Gravel asked Ms. Cat for the phone numbers of her lost friends, suggesting it might
		 be possible to obtain their call history, and Ms. Cat obliged.
		-Ms. Arnautovic, after clarifying that the caitiff we indeed members of the Camarilla in
		 good standing, offered up the safe haven. It may be safer, or at least offer us a
		 glimpse of whatever is gnawing on Ms. Cat.
			-She and B.O.B both accepted, and said they'd meet us back here shortly, with their
			 things.
			-We preferred to come with them, given that they seem to be being hunted, and they
			 assented.
	-They led us a short short walk away, to a alley blocked off with an improvised wall, behind
	 which were several shanties and Ms. Cat's own residence, an apartment in an abandoned building
	 bordering the alley which she entered through the window.
		-Layla White was already there, dressing up in a fancy but somewhat ill fitting dress.
		-Apparently Larry had stayed here too, and Ms. Gravel dug through his things.
		-She didn't find much related to Larry himself, but _all_ of them had a bunch of paper from
		 some company that wanted to test them for "Shire's Disease".
		-Asking about it, Ms. Cat and Mr. B.O.B. said that, shortly after the embraces, before they
		 knew what had happened, they donated some plasma (!).
		-We jumped down their throats on that one, insisting they never do such a thing again. They
		 seemed to only half understand how dangerous that was, but assented.
		-Ms. Gravel photographed the paper work, and then advised that they destory it.
			-The company name was Mastodon Pharmaceuticals. We retrieved that "yellow" box from one
			 of their subsideries, so maybe Kelly Haley would know more about them.
				-If you can get a sane word out of her. . .
		-As we got ready to depart. Mr. B.O.B. asked if Ms. White should not come with too, to which we
		 vigorously agreed.
			-She didn't wish to come, saying that Mr. Perez had invited her to a photoshoot.
			-That elicited something of an "Oh honey!" from Ms. Gravel, who explained that he was
			 clearly bullying her.
			-She went form crestfallen to near catatonic inside a of a minute or two. Mr. B.O.B
			 said something about her having "another meltdown", tossed her over her shoulder, and
			 then we were off.
	-I had Ms. Veck bring my car around, and Ms. Arnautovic fetched her own. We then headed back to
	 the haven.
		-As we were nearing the building, I received a message from Mr. Hubbard, saying that, after
		 reviewing security footage, they spotted a well, but anachronistically, dressed Nosferatu
		 standing, standing outside and watching the buiding, though no one had noticed at the time.
			-Characteristic of the clan's powers, as we've seen with Ms. Gravel.
		-I requested a description of the man, and, given it, I passed it to Ms. Gravel, who
		 recognized him as The Zookeeper, perhaps NYC's most skilled Animalism practitioner.	
			-Hmm. . . suspicious, given the giant rat bites.
			-He is also known as The Leech.
	-Once inside the haven, the caitiff got settled in one of the apartments, Ms. Arnautovic went
	 to talk to them, and Mr. Hubbard and I reviewed more footage, after an alarming suggestion from
	 Ms. Gravel that The Zookeeper may have followed us inside.
		-Fortunately, the footage showed no such thing. Whew.
	-After some time inside one of the apartments, Ms. Arnautovic emerged and said that she had a
	 way of tracking Tammy, asking for someone to drive her.
	-We all piled into my sedan, and followed Ms. Arnautovic's directions, to the morgue.
		-Well, not entirely a surprise. Not great, though, since Tammy's body may be a Masquerade
		 violation.
		-Ms. Gravel got out of the car, and slowly faded into the night as she walked towards the
		 morgue.
		-When she returned, she had a variety of interesting things to report.
			-Paperwork with Tammy indicated that she died from a stake through the heart, and that
			 the body had also been exsanguinated.
				-Apparently the _third_ such, according to the paperwork.
					-Of those other two, one was found dangling from a meet hook in a Hell's Kitchen
					 alley, and the other was strangled on Staten Island. Both were also
					 exsanguinated, but neither had been staked like Tammy.
			-Of interest to us, the stake had been removed, but Tammy was still thoroughly dead.
				-Ms. Gravel had taken a moment _to put the stake back in_.
			-She also mentioned that two people had been there asking questions about the matter, and
			 shared with us pictures she'd taken of them.
				-Ms. Felicity and I recognized one of them, a cop, and a ghoul belonging to Luca
				 Strossi, a Tremere.
				-We asked Ms. Arnautovic if she knew this Mr. Strossi. If he's trustworthy, and he
				 already has the matter of Tammy's body in hand, it may be best to leave it to the
				 Clan whose domain this is.
				-She was indeed able to reach out to him, calling him (though first looking for a
				 payphone before being reminded of her cell?), and he indicated that he felt the
				 matter was duely contained.
	-We then reached out to Mr. Nightwalker, to see if his business for the night was done, as we
	 needed some help tracking.
		-(And Nate was back from whatever he had going on tonight, free to join the rest of the
		 session.)
		-We met him near Mr. Larry's family home.
		-He showed up in full tactical gear, somewhat disheveled.
		-"Mr. Nightwalker, either I gave you the wrong impression or you've had an interesting night
		 thus far. . ."
		 "The latter, Mr. Nielsen. I've had a stressful couple of weeks. I can tell you the details
		 later, though, as I assume you called me here for a reason?"
		-I ran through what Ms. Cat had told us about her friends and their Final Deaths, and
		 explained that the parking garage here is where Mr. Larry died.
	-Mr. Nightwalker and Misses Gravel and Arnautovic looked carefully over the area.
		-They found traces of some mix of blood and. . . blue paint? It was lightly splattered over
		 the are, and drips led off to one of the garage's stairwells.
		-Mr. Nightwalker, fearing danger, saw to it that we were all outfitted from his considerable
		 arsenal.
			-Though, after seeing me handle the handgun he gave me, he quickly took it back, handing
			 me a taser.
		-We then followed the drips into the stairwell, and down.
		-Eventually, Ms. Felicity reported that the drops had. . . changed some how, part of each
		 somehow gone. We were unsure what that meant, though.
		-Ms. Arnautovic bent down and tasted a bit of the blood in the trail, reporting that it was
		 a mix of three individuals: a Nosferatu, a bengal tiger (?!?), and someone that tasted like
		 a human with the barest mix of Kindred.
		-Mr. Nightwalker, meanwhile, locked eyes with a pigeon, and then said it warned us to get
		 the fuck out of here, accompanied by some "weird buzzing, like insects."
		-We. . . chose to listen to the pigeon, heading back up the stairs.
		-As we headed back to my car, Sam held up his hand, calling our attention to a nearby car.
		-With Sam pointing him out, we could see, laying in the back of the car unmoving, The
		 Zookeeper.
		-We had a quick, somewhat nervous debate about what to do. Asking the air (and thus probably
		 an obfuscated Gravel), we all received a text from Ms. Gravel saying that she'd rather not
		 disturb her elders. . .
		-Eventually, I stepped forward, saying, "Mr. Zookeeper, are you in need of assistance?"
		-In response, pigeons, dozens of them, began to arrive in the area, surrounding us.
		-"Very well," I said, "You know where to find us."
		-We then walked back towards the car.
		-After some debate back there, Mr. Nightwalker was very insistent on heading back, to extend
		 the same offer again, and set out with (probably) an invisible Ms. Gravel in tow.
			-As to why? I couldn't talk him out of it, short of more. . . forceful means, and, eh,
			 it's his (and hopefully only his) Final Death.
			-Ms. Veck and I waited in the car, with the engine running. I looked around for Mr.
			 Nier, but he was already gone too.
			-While we waited in the car, we saw a giant rat emerge from a sewer out in the street,
			 and scurry into the garage. . .
				-Actually, Ms. Felicity thought it may be a very rough looking capybara. More
				 evidence it's tied to The Zookeeper.
				-Ms. Arnautovic chimed in, saying, "Oh! Those giant Mexican rats? When I was in
				 Mexico, there were always rumors of them carrying off children. . ."
					-In Mexico?!? When was she in a Sabbat stronghold? Before or after her embrace?
	-We then headed back to the safe haven.
		-Once there, Mr. Nightwalker recounted his recent adventures.
			-His sire, Effie May is apparently back in New York, living in Central Park, and. . .
			 is skittish.
			-He hasn't been able to find her, and the word he's received is that there's something
			 very wrong with her.
			-He claimed she's slowly transforming into a spider monster for some reason, and he
			 seemed to believe it might be something more than just his clan's curse.
			-He advocated informing the prince or sheriff about this, despite the danger that would
			 pose to Ms. May.
			-I agreed that would be wise, and agreed to call Sheriff Hawthorn on his behalf.
			-After leaving a message, he got back to me with via text a few minutes later.
				-I informed him that Mr. Nightwalker had told me Ms. May was back in the city.
				-He already knew, though he said she had thus far proved elusive.
				-I let him know she was supposedly staying in Central Park.
				-He added something else that he said I should know: The Leech was claiming that a
				 member of the coterie is Sabbat, and that he could prove it. . . (!!!)
			-A short while later, I received a message from an unknown number requesting I attend a
			 meeting at Wright Industries, and that I bring my coterie. It's to be in the penthouse
			 of their headquarters, at 3:00 the following night.
				-Kenneth Wright is the Ventrue Primogen, and my grand sire. He's very intense, and
				 rumored to be the founder of the first bank (the _literally_ first bank, founded
				 during The Crusades).


3/30/22:
	-Waking the following night, we heard further news reports about the "angels".
		-Apparently the claim is now that it was a hoax, and word is that someone was arrested for
		 wasting the NYPD's time.
	-With some time before our meeting with Mr. Wright, I tasked Ms. Veck with researching Mastodon,
	 and Ms. Gravel apparently spent her time doing the same.
		-When I awoke, Ms. Veck hadn't been able to turn up much, but, meeting up later, Ms. Gravel
		 had better luck.
		-It's a subsidiery of Autumn Health Mangement Systems.
		-Autumn, in turn, is controlled by another pharmaceutical company, Magadon.
	-I also took a moment to ask Ms. Arnautovic about her past visit to Mexico.
		-She claimed, convincingly, that it was while she was still a mortal, "10 or 20 years ago."
		-She also seemed aware that it was now not a safe place for her, raising the good point that
		 it is _particularly_ so for those embraced by Clan Tremere.
	-I was also informed, via messages from a few clanmates, that my status is not in question, but
	 that, for appearance's sake, I would be under investigation as well.
		-"Of course. I've nothing to hide. . ."
		-I also got word that Mr. Arkan has also shifted the focus of his media teams. Less concerned
		 with the winged man, he's turned his attention a series of killings that had occured, aiming
		 to calm public sentiment.
	-With the time of our meeting near, we all made our way to Wright Industries's headquarters, a
	 tall black skyscraper..
		-Taking the elevator up, we were met by a pair of men straight out of casting for a Godfather
		 movie, and were ushered into the penthouse's kitchen.
		-The decor was of course opulent, with the theme of the artwork tending towards currency,
		 with many forms of old coins and the like from across Christendom and the Middle East on
		 display, along with some Medieval artwork and armor.
			-Very much fits what they say of my grandsire's past.
		-While waiting in the kitchen, we also met Mr. Corelli for the first time.
			-We exchanged introductions and Mr. Corelli mentioned he was a recent arrival, who had
			 been "told to watch over us".
	-We were eventually ushered into conference room, where, around a table, sat the most prominent
	 Ventrue in the city, including Prince Panhard, Mr. Wright, and my sire, Mr. Dooley.
		-Mr. Wright launched right into things, opening a folder of photographs.
		 "The allegation that one of you was a member was a member of the Sabbat is very serious. I
		 am not, though, one to hold one's past against them. . .  I have known many who've risen
		 from the meanest origins to do great things.
		 This evidence is extensive, but why has it come to light _now_?"
		-Answering him, I said, "Sheriff Hawthorn informed me that the accusations came from The
		 Zookeeper, yes?"
		 "I know who the accusations came from. . ."
		 "We recently encountered Mr. Zookeeper, and seem to have disturbed some business of his
		 while looking into a disturbance among the caitiff, perhaps prompting the matter."
		-At the mention of the caitiff, several around the table looked distinctly uncomfortable,
		 and Mr. Wright then spoke, saying, "Let me be clear. There is no persecution of the caitiff
		 in New York. I want to hear you all repeat that."
		-The coterie complied, offering a round of denials.
			-I myself said, "We've seen no evidence of ill treatment of the caitiff by our society
			 at large, though we did see some. . . concerning indiscretions, resulting from their
			 ignorance."
		-After that, Dr. Emerich, a member of The Board, broke in, saying, "If I may, I'd like to
		 hear from Mr. Blutgel, since he is the one leveling these accustations. Could he be brought
		 in?"
		-Our host assented, and The Zookeeper stepped through the door, as if he'd been listening
		 at it.
		-Dr. Emerich then asked him, "Mr. Blutgel, why is it you've brought these accusations _now_?"
		 "Ms. Doyle asked me to look into the deaths of the caitiff. She has a soft spot for them.
		 While doing so, _they_ showed up. Naturally I looked into their backgrounds."
		 Staring at Ms. Arnautovic, he continued, saying, "I'm not trained in the sight, but if you
		 looked at _her_ aura, I suspect you'd find the thick black bands of diablerie."
		-Ms. Arnautovic, taken aback, spoke in her defense, saying she does not _remember_ partaking
		 in any such thing, and also leveled her own accusation at the Zookeeper, saying the caitiff
		 had wounds from one of the Zookeeper's animals.
		-"And do you have proof of this?" Dr. Emerich asked.
		 "Yes," Ms. Arnautovic responded, "Gravel, can I see you cellular telephone?"
		-Mr. Nightwalker then stepped aside, revealing Ms. Gravel hiding behind him, and she pulled
		 out the phone, handing it to Ms. Arnautovic. She, in turn, handed it to me, asking me to
		 pull up the photos for her. I did so, laying it on the conference table in front of us, and
		 The Board passed it around.
		-After looking at it, Mr. Wright asked The Zookeeper to bring his animals in, to have their
		 mouths examined.
		 ". . . Of course."
		 "And," Ms. Arnautovic broke in, "Be sure to bring in your capybara."
		-At this last, The Zookeeper looked distinctly uncomfortable, fearful.
		-"What's the matter, Zookeeper?" Ms. Arnautovic asked.
		 ". . . His teeth were broken, a few days ago."
		-That prompted a number of outbursts from our coterie, with Mr. Nightwalker offering modern
		 forensic's capabilities in the matter while Ms. Felicity directly accused The Zookeeper of
		 concocting this to distract The Board from whatever he's doing with the caitiff.
		-Ms. Arnautovic then offered the services of her clan, to determine the truth of this matter.
		-"If you are willing to subject yourself to disciplines," Mr. Wright responded, "I can
		 resolve the matter here and now."
		-She assented, but requested that a member of her clan be present, as she would not wish to
		 be compelled to reveal her clan's secrets.
		-The Board agreed to those terms, and reached out to the Tremere.
		-Ms. Felicity then asked if our coterie could adjourn to another room, to talk among
		 ourselves, and Mr. Wright agreed, saying he too would like a recess.
			-Turning to Mr. Zookeeper/Leech/Blutgel, Mr. Wright locked eyes with him, saying he
			 should wait in the next room until summoned.
			-I, though, was asked to remain behind with The Board.
			-As the others shuffled out, I was asked to sit, and Mr. Wright passed the photos to me.
			-They showed Ms. Arnautovic meeting with an 8' tall horror, with far too many eyes, and
			 several "South American drug lord types". They stood before bonfires and, in one image,
			 were shown sharing a silver chalice.
			-As I went through the photos, Prince Panhard, spoke, saying, "We recovered her when we
			 retook the city. She has the most complete knowledge of The Sabbat in the city, and has
			 been assisting Clan Tremere in understanding our enemies. The Sabbat Tremere apparently
			 all disappeared 20 years ago.
			 This secret must be kept. We will be assigning someone to watch over the coterie."
			 "What of the coterie?" I asked. "If present at this interrogation, are they to know the
			 truth?"
			 "If any find out about her history, you are to extend the same understanding to them.
			 Please collect the rest of the coterie."
		-I then returned to the kitchen, and let the others know The Board is ready for all of us
		 now.
		-After we filtered back in, Mr. Wright then approached Ms. Arnautovic, saying, "Please,
		 look into my eyes."
		-Ms. Arnautovic vacillated, saying, "But, wasn't one of my clanmates going to be here. . ."
		 "It would be best if you just answered my questions," Mr. Wright said. Continuing, he said,
		 "Ms. Arnautovic, are you a loyal member of the Camarilla?"
		 "Yes."
		-Turning, he then approached the Zookeeper, but, as he did so, a high pitched beeping began.
		-". . . the fire alarm?" Mr. Wright asked.
		-That prompted a flurry of action from Mr. Corelli, who conferred with a besuited mortal who
		 apparently answers to him, sending him off in search of fire extinguisher, as we all began
		 to smell smoke from the next room.
		-Ms. Gravel was gone from my sight by the time I looked around, but Ms. Arnautovic asked Mr.
		 Nightwalker to block the door, "Lest The Leech try to escape."
		-That prompted a question from Mr. Wright, who said, "Perhaps we should evacuate?"
		-That met with enthusiatic agreement from The Zookeeper, who yelled, "Yes! We need to get
		 out of here before this building burns down around us!"
		-"Why so eager to leave before your testimony?" Ms. Arnautovic asked, "I think that perhaps
		 there _is_ a member of the Sabbat here, a certain Nosferatu. . ."
		-At that, The Zookeeper lept for the door, nearly making it past Mr. Nightwalker who caught
		 his leg, dragging him back into the room and hurling him against the wall opposite the door.
		-Mr. Nightwalker then began to grow claws, while Ms. Arnautovic reached out, placing a palm
		 against The Zookeeper's chest, prompting him to. . . blush?
		-Mr. Nightwalker called for my aid, but, before I could react, we all heard a shout, "Move
		 aside!"
		-We could do nothing but obey as Mr. Wright rushed forward, drawing a kukri, and, in four
		 quick strokes, severed each of The Zookeeper's limbs.
			-Beyond blood, a torrent of maggots poured forth from each of the wounds.
		-Gazing into The Zookeeper's now frantic eyes, Mr. Wright, voice hot with anger, said, "You
		 have violated my hospitality. Are _you_ a member of The Sabbat?"
		 "Yes."
		-At that, Mr. Wright beheaded him.
			-Sam then grabbed one of the maggots from the floor, placing it inside a metal container
			 he pulled out of his pocket.
		-"I'm sorry," Mr. Wright said, "For losing my temper. . . Moving on, I will have Mr. Corelli
		 here watch over your coterie. There is to be no mention of what happened here tonight."
		-Prince Panhard then spoke, saying, "I will also have my agents watch over you. For the sake
		 of convenience, I want all of you to make your permanent haven on the 13th floor."
		-Ms. Arnautovic objected, though, saying that she'd be expected to meet some nights at her
		 clan's chantry.
		-"I'm sure the regent will be understanding," Mr. Wright responded.
		-"I should take a vacation from work, then?" Mr. Nightwalker asked.
		-"You will be required to make your haven there," Prince Panhard answered, "But need not
		 remain there _always_."
			-This elicited an annoyed look from Mr. Wright, though it was soon followed by a nod.
		-Mr. Wright then spoke again, saying, "Enjoy yourselves for the rest of the night. My home
		 is open to you and refreshments are availble in the refridgerator. Please just return to
		 your haven an hour before dawn."
		-Prince Panhard then dismissed the board, leaving herself too, with now only Mr. Wright
		 remaining at the table.
		-As Sam wandered off in the direction of the now diminished smoke, and Mr. Nightwalker to
		 the kitchen, Ms. Arnautovic approached Mr. Wright.
			-"This evidence against me, could I see it?" she asked.
			-Mr. Wright responded by handing the folio to Ms. Arnautovic.
			-She spent some time examining them, eventually saying, "Some of these figures, I've
			 never seen them before. These photographs must have been doctored."
			-Turning to me, Mr. Wright asked, "Mr. Nielsen, you're better with technology than I.
			 Is such a thing possible?"
			 "Certainly so. It would require substantial resources, and is unlikely to be perfect,
			 but it is certainly _possible_.'
			 "Please examine the photographs, then. These are the most damning evidence against Ms.
			 Arnautovic. If they could be proven false. . ."
			 "Of course. I will put my people on it."
		-The maggots on the floor were slowly dying, or more quickly, once Sam returned to look at
		 them. . .
		-Mr. Corelli eventually returned to the board room, reporting that the fire was out, and
		 that, alongside it, the corpse of a monkey was found, and also a hole cut into a wall,
		 where a water line was damaged.
			-So, we were not wrong that the fire was awfully convenient for The Zookeeper's purposes.
		-We then decided to return to the safe haven, and loaded into the elevator.
			-Once the doors closed, Mr. Corelli somewhat presumptuously began making demands, asking
			 first, "Which one of you is best at organizing?"
			-I spoke up, as Mr. Nightwalker pointed to me as well.
			-"I need to deliver reports to Mr. Wright," Mr. Corelli said, "You're going to help me
			 put them together. I don't want to be caught in the middle of this mess any more than
			 I have to be.
			-"I would be happy to assist you in your reports to my grandsire," I replied. "I would
			 also like to discuss security arrangements with you, since that seems to be along the
			 lines of your business. Your. . . employees can take shifts monitoring the haven,
			 particularly the day shift, freeing up the use of mine."
	-We retrieved our various vehicles and headed back to the haven.
		-On the way back, the streets were obviously. . . wilder than usual. Chaos abounded, with
		 the kine acting like lunatics and cars veering all over the street, driving wildly.
		-The radio also reported sightings of a "Loch Ness Monster of New York", a great beast in
		 the water seen by all aboard a ferry, though the report was quickly followed by an
		 explanation claiming the food aboard the ship may have been poisoned by ecoterrorists.
	-Arriving back at the haven, we could hear loud music, and smell weed, coming from the room
	 where the caitiff were staying.
		-Ms. Arnautovic knocked on the door, yielding a visibly drunk Ms. Cat, with a beer can in
		 her hand.
			-Thin blood indeed. . .
		-Ms. Anautovic informed them that we'd dealt with their issue.
		-I hustled up and added to that, "Yes. We've. . . dealt with the one who was preying on you.
		 There should be no more waking up with bite marks."
			-Good to have them out of our hair, given what I promised The Board about the caitiff.
		-"Really?" Ms. Cat slurred, "That's great! B. O. B., did you hear that! We can go home!"
		-He was sitting on the couch smoking a bong, listening to bad punk rock. "Layla! Pull
		 yourself together. We're going home!"
		-That was met only with sobs from the bedroom.
		-"What's the matter with her?" Ms. Gravel asked. "Still broken up by that Toreador bullying
		 her?"
		 "Nah," B. O. B. responded, "She's been itchy, says something's biting her."
		 "Maybe she caught The Zookeeper's fleas," Ms. Gravel suggested.
		 "Can that happen?" B. O. B. asked.
		 "I don't see why not."
	-As we returned to the hall Ms. Anautovic pulled me aside and asked about one of the rooms,
	 saying that she needed space for her rituals, where they would not be disturbed.
	 "Of course. We may be a bit tight on space here now, but, if you need. . . lab space, by all
	 means, claim one of the rooms."
	-As soon as the words left my mouth, she nodded, and hurried off into the apartment, slamming
	 the door behind her.
	-Ms. Gravel then said that, if there's a cot or the like about, she'll be happy with a closet
	 or some similar space.
		-I said I'd have Mr. Horton pick something up once stores opened in the morning.
	-I then took some time to introduce Mr. Corelli to Mr. Hubbard and Ms. Veck, mentioning also
	 that Mr. Horton handles the day shift.
		-I asked him if his employees would be staying with us, and he indicated that Mr. Pauli
		 would be, though the other two would be tending to his business interests.
			-Elaborating, he mentioned that he has a tow yard and collection of vehicles.
			-"A useful resource indeed, Mr. Corelli."
		-I then asked if Mr. Pauli would mind taking tomorrow's day shift, if we'll be sending Mr.
		 Horton furniture shopping, and Mr. Corelli assented. I turned Mr. Pauli over to Ms. Veck,
		 to get him familiarized with the system and set up with a login.
	-Next, I began to receive a series of _very_ alarming texts from Mr. Nightwalker. . .
		-https://discord.com/channels/930231429286207539/933428895863160913/958915821541929000
		-Eventually, he called me, and, putting him on speaker phone, we (rather frantically)
		 discussed the matter.
		-The. . . matter was currently in a lead-lined case inside Mr. Nightwalker's car, but he
		 was tied up with whatever was going on with Mr. Nier.
		-We ulimately settled on having Mr. Corelli arrange to have the car towed by his people,
		 moving it to his tow yard.
			-I confirmed that the "cultists" Mr. Nightwalker had mentioned had not yet seen the car,
			 so hopefully we don't need to worry about them finding it.
		-I also added a geiger counter to Mr. Horton's morning shopping list.
		-Eventually I received another text message saying the cultist was dead, and the immediate
		 danger dealt with.
			-Whew.
		-We decided to still have the car towed, and made arrangements to have Mr. Horton pick up
		 Misters Nier and Nightwalker. They would be sleeping in body bags at Mr. Nier's bomb
		 shelter / haven, and Mr. Horton loaded them into my van during the day and brough them back
		 to the haven.
	-Thankfully, with dawn, we slept like the dead.
		-This night has been more than enough to give any among the kine bad dreams. . .
	-The next evening, we had a lot to discuss.
		-Mr. Nier seemed to believe the danger had been dealt with when he killed the leader of his
		 cult last night.
			-To confirm that, I offered him my assistance in interrogating members of the cult.
		-Ms. Gravel, meanwhile, took our new geiger counter to the caitiffs' room, concerned now
		 about Ms. White's scratching.
			-Nothing in there was radioactive, but Mr. Nier sure as hell is. It clicked like crazy
			 until she asked him to go somewhere else for the moment.
		-When she returned, though, she reported that Ms. White was still in quite a state, having had
		 a daymare, or perhaps a vision.
			-Ms. Gravel reported that Ms. White was yelling about something being "awake" and
			 "watching".
			-Ms. Arnautovic went to question her further, with the rest of us trailing after.
				-In response to Ms. Arnautovic's questions, Ms. White described whatever this was
				 as "bright" and "burning", prompting Sam to claim he'd dreamed of something similar.
		-Mr. Nightwalker also pulled me aside to let me know that one of his contacts had informed
		 him that his sire had grown. . . more active, attacking people on the street.
			-He let me know because he'd heard Mr. Corelli pushing the matter of reports to Mr.
			 Wright off onto me, and wanted this included.
			-I asked him what he hoped would be done about his sire, and he washed his hands of the
			 matter.
			-Very well, I'll forward the information and let the sheriff resolved the matter as he
			 will.


TODO:
	-Look into those photos, the evidence against Ms. Arnautovic.
		-Sent to Til and Lesley:
			Sometime shortly after the events of our last session, Mr. Nielsen wants to get some time alone with Ms. Arnautovic (a thing probably eased by his control over the haven's closed circuit cameras). Assuming he manages that, he opens with:
			"Good evening, Ms. Arnautovic. I was hoping to discuss those photographs with you, the matter that Primogen Wright requested my assitance with.
			You see, when I spoke with The Board privately, he confided in me that there was rather more truth to The Zookeeper's allegations than it would serve the sect's interests to acknowledge, saying that you are a very valuable resource in our conflict with The Sabbat.
			As such, I wish to offer you my full assistance in the matter of these. . . doctored photographs, to help in arriving at the truth of the matter, whatever that truth must be. To do so, though, I must ask you: exactly what elements in the photos are not as you recall?"
		-We then later did some stuff over voice:
			-Ms. Arnautovic said the woman in the back of some of the photographs should not be
			 there, though she recognized her, naming her "The Regent of the Sabbat, it's leader" (!).
				-She thought The Regent may be a Lasombra, who thus should not have shown up in _any_
				 photo, saying this thus should be impossible.
			-She also said that, during the seige of New York, only the Tremere remained in the city,
			 in their hidden chantry.
				-Though I'd also heard rumors that the Nosferatu had managed to remain as well.
				-In the course of the struggle, she ended up in torpor.
					-That explains a lot of her relationship with technology. . .
			-She explained to me the Vaulderie, pointing out the chalice in one of the photographs.
				-She admitted to participating, but broke it through the powers of the Tremere.
				-She claimed they also have the ability to break the normal bond too. . .
			-I suggested we falsify the whole thing, or at least imply as much, if we find only one
			 issue with the photos.
			-She offered up info on The Sabbat, form her past espionage.
			-While we talked, I received a text from Ms. Veck.
				-She reported that something strange had been seen on the cameras up front,
				 including a screenshot.
				-"This man was walking by, staring directly at the building. He spit on the
				 sidewalk, and walked away. The video shows him mouthing a name: Vittoria.
				 We looked at the video again, the "spit" looks like blood.
				-Ms. Arnautovic thought him Tremere, and vaguely recognized him, but did not know a
				 name.
				-She indicated we should carefully cleanse the area, fearing blood magic, but first
				 she wanted to test the blood.
			-We went down, escorted by Mr. Hubbard.
				-Ms. Arnautovic collected all of the blood she could, into a small glass vial from
				 her purse.
				-We then set Mr. Hubbard to carefully cleaning the area.
				-Ms. Arnautovic also asked around about the man, checking with the doorman and the
				 like.
					-They described him as dressed like a "pompous asshole", in silks and "Satanic
					 jewelry".
					-She also spread rumors that he was wanted, tracked by bounty hunters, and gave
					 out Mr. Nightwalker's card, asking them to contact him if they see the man.
				-She adjourned to her room, to perform whatever ritual is necessary to examine the
				 blood, but never reported back.
					-We saw her leave, via the cameras, hailing a cab.
		-Actually examine the photos!
			-Til will be gone for a bit, so it'll be a while before you can discuss the matter with
			 Ms. Arnautovic.
			-(DONE!) Rolls?
				-Ms. Veck or Mr. Horton can take point, with assistance from the other and myself,
				 unless this would fall under Mr. Horton's security specialty.
	-Prepare a report for Primogen Wright.
		-The dirty bomb.
		-Ms. Arnautovic's photos.
			-Results of computer analysis.
			-The Regent's improbable presence.
		-Ms. Arnautovic's absence.
		-Got a response concerning all but maybe the photos here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/965397960726827088
			-He's aware of Ms. Arnautovic's absence already and his "hands are tied".
			-As concerned about the dirty bomb as I am.
	-Sent Lesley a message about Computer rolls and the report here: https://discord.com/channels/@me/772891797726822481/965391239140737104
		-"you have a relative idea of what is fake in a few photos, its at least enough to cast doubt on the authenticity of the photos."
	-Spend some of your 17 XP?
		-10 for Dominate 3 is a no brainer if time permits.
		-4 for Subterfuge 3 as well?


4/21/22:
	-It's been a week since the events of our last session.
	-I received a call from Mr. Nightwalker.
		-He reported some trouble with his girlfriend. She was missing.
			-Hmm. . . first I've heard of this woman. This seems an unexpected weakness on Mr.
			 Nightwalker's part.
		-He had access to the GPS data from her phone, though, and saw it had her at The Brooklyn
		 Bridge, for the past several hours. . .
		-I asked him what I could do to help.
			-He asked for my aid in finding her, expressing some concern about his still-at-large
			 sire. . .
			-He also asked if Ms. Gravel was at the haven. After I got off the phone with Mr.
			 Nightwalker, I looked around and she was out, but I gave her a call.
			-I explained that Mr. Nightwalker had a missing friend, and had asked for our aid, and
			 she was willing to help too.
		-Mr. Nightwalker picked me up from the haven, along with Mr. Hubbard, and we picked up Ms.
		 Gravel along the way.
			-Mr. Nightwalker was clearly agitated, and driving aggressively. Along the way, he
			 confided in us that she "means the world" to him.
			-He also handed each of us a series of photographs of her. Ever the detective. . .
		-Parking near the bridge, we made our way to the bridge's center, via it's pedestrian access,
		 as that's where the GPS signal was coming from.
		-Looking around, Mr. Hubbard eventually pointed out the cellphone, stuck in a spiderweb
		 thirty feet down one of the bridge's supports.
			-As Mr. Nightwalker paced angrily, apparently looking for a way down, I volunteered a
			 drone. I woke Mr. Horton with a phone call, and he said he could be there with one from
			 the security company in Brooklyn in roughly 20 minutes.
		-While we waited, I suggested we have a look around, to see if there's anything else we can
		 find to figure out what happened here.
		-Ms. Gravel did some looking, and then pointed out to me some security cameras on the bridge.
			-I volunteered Mr. Hotron's services there too, though warned that avenue would take
			 substantial time to pursue.
		-Ms. Gravel then disappeared for a bit, texting me a few minutes later.
			-She wanted me to let Mr. Nightwalker know she'd found a trail. . . of blood. She
			 included the address of an alley by the Brooklyn side of the bridge, where she said
			 we should meet her.
			-I broke the news to Mr. Nightwalker as gently as I could, and then we hurried that way.
		-There were indeed signs of an attack, and the other end of the trail went _up the side_ of
		 a building near the alley.
			-It was a house, and, approaching it, it looked abandoned. It had an eviction notice from
			 2001 on the boarded up door.
			-Looking closely, Ms. Gravel pointed at claw marks going up the side of it.
			-Sure seems like Mr. Nightwalker's hypothesis about his sire's involvement is correct. . .
			-Mr. Nightwalker drew his firearm and started walking towards the building's doorway,
			 but then paused a moment, saying, "Mr. Nielsen, you should let The Sheriff know we've
			 found one of Effie May's hideouts."
				-I did just that, texting him the address.
			-He then continued on to the door, pulling the plywood away and kicking it in.
				-It swung in easily, it having apparently been kicked in previously, from the damage
				 around the knob, and had now been held closed only by spider webs.
			-Inside, the place was covered in huge cobwebs.
			-Moving deeper into the building, we could see a butchered, half-eaten dog lying on the
			 floor and, on a kitchen counter, a man's corpse with it's chest cavity torn open.
				-The human corpse had been drained of blood, apparently before it's organs were
				 pulled out of it's chest and scattered about it.
				-The heart, though, was missing.
			-Mr. Hubbard spotted something in a nearby room with a half open door.
				-"Hey, Nightwalker. Looks like there's another mess in this room."
				-It turned out to be another male corpse, bloated, and in biker leathers.
			-Kicking open the door to another room, Mr. Nightwalker shouted something inarticulate,
			 and rushed inside.
				-Mr. Hubbard followed him in, and than I myself in turn (Ms. Gravel was
				 characteristically nowhere to be seen).
				-Inside was a bedroom, and on one lay an unconscious woman. Presumably Mr.
				 Nightwalker's girlfriend, from how he was reacting.
					-She did not look good. There was a bite wound on her neck, and other signs of
					 blood loss.
				-Mr. Nightwalker tried cutting his way through the webs towards here, but quickly
				 found himself caught in them.
				-He then pulled out a lighter from his jacket pocket and seemed to consider doing
				 something rash, but then froze and dropped it at his feet.
				-Mr. Hubbard stepped forward and tried pulling him free, but to no avail.
				-While they struggled with that, Ms. Gravel eventually appeared, carrying a bucket
				 of water which she proceeded to dump on Mr. Nightwalker and the webs.
				-That seemed to damage them substantially, and cut down somewhat on the stickiness,
				 allowing another tug from Mr. Hubbard to get Mr. Nightwalker free.
				-Misters Nightwalker and Hubbard began hacking away at the webbing, trying to reach
				 the woman lying on the bed, as Ms. Gravel and I retrieved more water from the
				 kitchen.
				-It was far slower work than we would have hoped, but, eventually, Mr. Nightwalker
				 was able to reach her.
				-She was breathing shallowly, but had clearly suffered severe blood loss.
				-Beside her, on the bed's nightstand, there was a strange coin, bearing the image
				 of a many legged spider.
				-Mr. Nightwalker and Ms. Gravel both examined the unconscious woman, with him then
				 turning an anguished face to the wall.
				-She seemed to believe there was hope, though, and asked a suddenly uncomfortable
				 Mr. Horton what his blood type was.
				 "B+," I volunteered, "Though I don't know how you'd perform a transfusion here."
				 ". . . It's not a match anyways," Mr. Nightwalker added. "I could make her a ghoul,
				 though. . ."
				 "But, if it's too late. . ." Ms. Gravel protested.
				-Mr. Nightwalker cut further debate short, by also cutting his hand, fed her his
				 blood.
					-She did not respond, and eventually, her breathing stopped.
				-Rage was plain on Mr. Nightwalker's face, but he showed admirable self control.
				-He lifted her limp body from the bed, and began to head for the room's door.
					-He grabbed the spider coin too.
				-As he crossed the threshold, she reached up, to touch his face.
					-Relief now mixed with worry on his face.
			-Ms. Gravel, Mr. Nightwalker, and I followed him out onto the street but, as he ran
			 towards the bridge, and his car on the Manhatten side of it, we stopped short, and I
			 gave Mr. Horton a call.
				-He was four blocks away, and picked us up at the abandoned house.
			-While we waited, I received another text from Mr. Nightwalker, saying that the
			 situation was under control, for tonight, anyways.
	-On our way back to the haven, I got a message from Ms. Veck, saying that Mr. Nier was on the
	 roof of the building. Indeed, as we got out of the car, we could see him up there at one
	 corner, pointing at the sky.
		-Once inside the haven, I asked Ms. Veck, "How long has he been up there?"
		 "More or less since you left."
		-Mr. Corelli eventually tried to retrieve him, but Mr. Nier didn't make it easy, darting
		 around the roof in a Benny Hill routine. Eventually Mr. Corelli gave up, and left him to
		 it.
		-When Mr. Nier eventually made his way back down into the haven on his own, he was babbling
		 about a red star, and how it "hungered".
			-Well, not hard to tell where that imagery would come from, though it's of course hard
			 to tell whether the _sane_ should be concerned.
	-I then got a call from Sheriff Hawthorn, following up about our message about Ms. May's lair.
		-I was somewhat evasive, letting him know we'd found a place she'd been staying, with bodies
		 inside, and otherwise also let him know that Mr. Nightwalker will likely be contacting him
		 soon, but that, "He's still sorting through his feelings about tonight."
		-A call from The Prince to Sheriff Hawthorn cut the conversation short, though, and I
		 graciously, though unecessarily, said that, "Of course you should take it."
		-Mr. Nier witnessed the whole call, and seemed to know I was holding something back.
		-I told him it was a personal matter of Mr. Nightwalker's, and suggested we give him the
		 night to sort the matter out. "If he does not, though. . . well, we may need to press him
		 on the matter."
	-A short while later, each of us at the haven received a text, requesting our presence at
	 Elysium in 30 minutes.
		-I had Ms. Veck bring my towncar around.
		-During the ride, Mr. Nier continued to babble about a red star. One that, looking, none
		 of the rest of us could see.
			-We admitted that, to his consternation, but he then claimed that, "Well, not all have
			 the insight my clan does."
		-We arrived there on time, meeting Mr. Nightwalker, his girlfriend, and Ms. Felicity there.
			-Mr. Nightwalker was noteable well dressed, as one would expect as he attended what's
			 sure to be his trial.
			-Ms. Barron, on the other hand, now had a set of noticeable rat-like hands.
		-The club appeared to be closing down, with revelers leaving and, within, the music silenced.
		-Entering the dance floor, we saw Mr. Garett, who apologized to Mr. Nightwalker, but then
		 searched him and his girlfriend, had them kneel, and placed them in handcuffs.
		-Meanwhile, Mr. Perez escorted the rest of us to nearby tables.
			-There were few others about, a handful of Toreador and Nosferatu, and the prince,
			 sitting in the raised section.
		-After everyone was settled, Prince Panhard stepped forward.
			-Her presence was overwhelming, and she was clearly displeased.
			-She castigated Mr. Nightwalker, reminding him that he was just recently, and generously,
			 welcomed into the society of this city, and asking him why he thought he could violate
			 one of the sect's most sacred traditions.
			-He responded with the story of discovering the near completely drained Ashley,
			 professing his love for her and explaining he had meant to make a ghoul of her, to save
			 her life, but that it turned out she was too far gone, with this being the result.
			-This didn't seem to please Prince Panhard, but neither was she clearly enraged.
			-She spoke, then, after a look at Ms. Ashley, saying, "It will be her loyalty that saves
			 your life."
			-She then asked Sheriff Hawthorn to take Ms. Ashley away and imprison her, saying she
			 would be dealt with tomorrow night. He of course complied.
			-She also turned to Seneschal D'Franco, instructing her to call Elysium for tomorrow
			 night.
			-Prince Panhard then asked each member of the coterie for our opinions as to what to do
			 with Mr. Nightwalker.
				-She turned to me first, and I recounted the facts of the evening. As to my
				 assessment of Mr. Nightwalker, I said that his destruction would mean the loss of
				 a useful asset to the sect, that his motivations appear to be as he described, and
				 that, prior to this, he was an upstanding member of the sect, proactively involving
				 himself in resolving several recent threats.
				-The others, in turn, all voiced some variation on the opinion that it would be a
				 shame if he had to die, though also mostly saying it was hardly _their_ place to
				 pass such judgment.
			-Prince Panhard paused a moment, and then addressed Mr. Nightwalker, saying, "It is my
			 judgement that you will live. But you will stand by my side tomorrow night, and hunt
			 with me. During the blood hunt that will be called tomorrow night for Ms. Barron.
			 After that, I will turn you over to Mr. Nielsen. For a year and a day, you will serve
			 him, as his retainer. In the meantime, your rights as a member of The Camarilla in
			 good standing are suspended."
			-I nodded, saying, "You honor me, Prince Panhard."
		-The Prince then turned and left, and Seneschal D'Franco approached us. "Elysium tomorrow
		 night will start two hours after sunset," she announced.
		-As she too left, so did many of the others attending.
			-On _his_ way our, Mr. Jefferson, a Nosferatu, paused to offer Mr. Nightwalker his
			 condolences, saying, "Sorry, kid. That's a bad rap. Would make a good blues song."
				-"Blind" Willie Jefferson is every ugly inch the blues musician.
		-The shaken Mr. Nightwalker then approached me, rattling off, "Cadusis Nightwalker,
		 reporting for duty. What are your orders?"
		 "We'll worry about that back at the haven. It's been a rough enough night already."
		-We then all returned to the haven, with several members of the coterie then attending to
		 personal business.
			-Mr. Nightwalker, Mr. Nier, and I remained at the haven.
				-Mr. Nightwalker continued to defer somewhat excessively to me, but I told him, "You
				 should relax as much as possible for the remainder of this evening. But, please,
				 don't leave the haven."
				-He agreed, and then brough up the coin.
					-He said that he thought his sire had left it as a calling card.
					 "You recognize it, then?"
					 ". . . no."
					 "Well, then it may explain something of Ms. May's current state. Ms. Veck!"
						-I had her do a reverse image search for the sides of the coin while Mr.
						 Nightwalker reached out to some contacts of his, but neither turned up
						 anything about it.
						-Mr. Nightwalker then suggested we might wish to reach out to Ms. Arnautovic,
						 saying an occultist might be called for.
							-I told him I haven't seen her in a week, but Mr. Nier also spoke saying
							 he knew a few things about the subject, and asked to take a look.
							-He claimed it was a depiction of Anansi, a West African spider god, a
							 god of knowledge and stories.
							-Ms. Gravel had also mentioned some studies in the area of mythology, so
							 we gave her a call too.
								-She reported much the same, but also said she'd go through her own
								 library, and report back.
								-When she contacted us again an hour or two later, she told us about
								 _syncretized_ spider gods, speaking of how a variety of regional
								 traditions were rolled into the Anansi myth.
								-The coin depicts a particular regional variation, native to the
								 New York area.
								-As such, she also suggested looking into local voodoo groups, to
								 follow up on the matter.
			-After that, Mr. Nier spent a few hours on the internet and then emerged from one of
			 the apartments, waving a printed pop-science article saying, "NASA calls it 2001KX76!
			 When the telescope gets in, you'll all see I'm not crazy!"
				-Apparently he's found at least _some_ confirmation of his red star.


TODO:
	-Lesley mentioned that, in exchange for a major boon, you likely _could_ get Prince Panhard to
	 spare Ms. Barron.
		-Hmm. . . Mr. Nielsen _did_ think the whole idea of Mr. Nightwalker having a girlfriend
		 to. . . be a poor choice when he heard about her.
		-I don't think he's had many especially genuine human relationships either, to really
		 sympathize.
		-On the other hand, two Gangrel owing you big. . .
			-Two of three Gangrel known to be in the city, in fact, with the other condemned by the
			 sect.
			-Ms. Barron's embrace also _does_ somewhat resolve my concerns about Mr. Nightwalker
			 having a "girlfriend". Doting on a childe is at least. . . more seemly then doting on
			 the kine, and it at least _changes_ the set of liabilities she creates, while offering
			 much more in return.
			-You and most of your clanmates would never _voice_ any comment about the two loyal dogs
			 at your side, but your fellows _will_ see it, to desirable effect.
			-If you _don't_ do this, Mr. Nightwalker might not be good for much, costing you what
			 he already owes you.
				-His discussions in #general about finding where she'd have to run to be safe
				 suggest a major incident soon is likely.
		-Reaching out to the Prince:
			-Sell as a partial solution to Sheriff Hawthorn's spider problem?
				-That could also go a ways towards space for one more among the kindred of New York. . .
			-One way or another, you _do_ want to try to _sell_ the concept. It's who you are, and,
			 whether it leads to a reduction in the severity of the debt, a potential avenue for
			 paying part of it back, or nothing more than an acknowledgement of the effort, it seems
			 worthwhile.
			-Reach out privately, offering refusal, "if there's something more to this than I'm
			 seeing, the costs of which outweighing what I hope to gain here."
			-You're quite happy, though, once the deal is done, for it to _then_ be public. Though
			 it may hurt your status to share that you begged a favor of the prince, it will bind
			 the Gangrel all the tighter to you, and perhaps evetually _increase_ your status,
			 should this investment turn out favorably.
				-Those few among the kindred who are more moral than Machiavellian are also likely
				 to think favorably of the matter right from the outset.
		-Talked through the request with Lesley:
			-Scheduled a meeting, resulting in Prince Panhard and Seneschal D'Franco coming to my
			 office.
			-Begged the favor of her, _as her clanmate_ (a thing she clarified). Sold what I'd
			 planned, emphasizing that this matter was likely to break Mr. Nightwalker, to the
			 detriment of both of our interests in the haven, but that, were it avoided, we'd be
			 handed two Gangrel with a very vested interest in resolving Sheriff Hawthorn's spider
			 problem.
				-Rolled 11 (!) successes selling it.
			-She accepted, and of course required of me a future boon, but also said that the matter
			 must still be punished.
				-"How fragile is Mr. Nightwalker?" she asked.
				 "Over the events of this evening, and our acquaintence prior to it, he has
				  exhibited admirable self-control. Though I think the matter of this hunt would
				  likely destroy him, not much shy of it seems likely to."
				 "Allowing Mr. Nightwalker to remain has already been seen as weak, and some think
				  him a spy, sent by our enemies into the city.
				  He must still be punished. There will be no blood hunt tomorrow night. . . for Ms.
				  Barron. If Mr. Nightwalker survives the night, he will be pardoned. The girl will
				  be marked by the Tremere, and bound to the Primogen Council."
				 "A trial by ordeal. . . that seems most wise, and fitting, given my hopes for Mr.
				  Nightwalker."
				-She then got up to leave, turning as she went to say, "I hope you know what you're
				 doing. The board is watching you. You have a unique oppotunity. Prove yourself here."
			-We have until the next night to prepare.
				-Shortly after my meeting, I receive a text informing me that Elysium will not be
				 held at the usual location, but rather at a theater that is the domain of Clan
				 Toreador.
		-Did some great roleplaying with Nate and Lesley here, breaking the news to Mr. Nightwalker: https://discord.com/channels/@me/968560386582397009/968570419802165280
		-Hunt ideas, to help or at least avoid harming Mr. Nightwalker?
			-Social disciplines on mortals, having them keep watch for him, bringing word back to me?
				-Looks identical to participation, and offers opportunities to intervene in other
				 ways if necessary.


4/28/22:
	-You spent the first hour or two the next evening checking in on your companies, and making a. . .
	 withdrawal at the blood testing firm.
	-A short while before Elysium was scheduled, I received a text, saying the it had been moved, and
	 providing a new address.
		-It still seemed to be a theater, though, and soon I was on my way there, with Ms. Veck
		 driving.
			-None of the others rode with me, but, after asking my permission to leave, Mr.
			 Nightwalker followed my car on a motorcycle.
		-When Ms. Gravel arrived, she had with her easily the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
		-"Ms. Gravel, who is your friend?" I asked. "I don't believe I've seen you around the city
		  before. . .?"
		 "She's new in the city, and looking to be introduced tonight."
		 "I am Tessa Laveau," she spoke up for herself.
		-Ms. Felicity, though, seemed previously acquainted with Ms. Nouveau, and asked her and Ms.
		 Gravel to step aside for a moment. The conferred privately for a couple of minutes, and Ms.
		 Laveau.
		-Meanwhile, Sheriff Hawthorn came to collect Mr. Nightwalker, asking him to follow and
		 leading him deeper into the theater.
		-A short moment later, Seneschal D'Franco stepped out of the theaters doors, walking up to
		 Ms. Gravel.
			-Standing a short distance away, I could overhear most of what they said. Seneschal
			 D'Franco addressed Ms. Gravel, saying, "I spoke with Tessa Laveau. She insisted that
			 _you_ should be the one to intorduce her. Dawn, though, is already scheduled to do so."
				-Dawn Fadel is Ms. Felicity's sire, and perhaps Ms. Laveau's, from bits of chatter
				 I've heard.
				-Convention would dictate that one's sire would perform the introduction, where
				 possible.
			-Ms. Doyle, the harpy of Manhatten, meanwhile had walked out of the theater. She now
			 approached the group and said, "Please, yes! Do it, Gravel! It will just be delightful!
			 I'll be ever so pleased if you do."
			-My observation of Ms. Gravel's discomfort was interrupted then, as Ms. Felicity asked
			 to speak to me.
				-"Of course. What can I assist you with?"
				 "I have heard rumors that an elder is going to be attacked tonight. I can't tell
				  you where I heard it from, but they said it was going to happen in a junkyard in
				  Brooklyn."
				 "That's grave news. Do you know who?"
				 "Karen Staley." (She's the Toreador Primogen.)
				 "Are you acquainted with Ms. Staley? She being your clanmate?"
				 "She is. . . not fond of me."
				 "I see. And what would you wish to come of the matter, then?"
				 "I can't just do _nothing_. Not if someone is going to get hurt. . ."
				 "These sources of yours, are they something you'd be willing to bring before the
				  prince? Are you confident in them, and willing to risk bringing her attention to
				  them?"
				 "I. . . we have to do, _something_."
				 "Maybe the sheriff instead? It _is_ a security matter. . ." I said, thinking aloud.
				-"Lets step inside, and see who's available," I continued, offering Ms. Felicity my
				 arm. She took it and we walked through the theater's doors.
	-Stepping within, my attention was first caught by a trio of disturbing paintings up on the
	 stage.
		-The subject matter was unsurprisingly grim, given the gathering, long on red, death, and
		 mass.
		-Mr. Nier was drawn straight to them, of course, and immediately approached the stage and
		 began to stare at them.
		-I, meanwhile, scanned the crowd.
			-Sheriff Hawthorn was up on stage, standing beside Ms. Barron and Mr. Nightwalker.
			-Prince Panhard sat beside Primogen Wright, in a box next to the stage.
			-I opted to send a text to Sheriff Hawthorn, saying, "I've heard rumors concerning Ms.
			 Staley's safety this evening, and wished to alert you."
				-He looked at his phone, then to me, and then began typing away himself.
				-No response came to me, but Mr. Mason, in the floor seats in front of me, pulled
				 out _his_ phone, looked at it, and then walked up onto the stage, near Sheriff
				 Hawthorn.
	-Shortly thereafter, Seneschal D'Franco, from on stage, looked to Prince and then announced,
	 "Get settled. We'll be starting."
		-"We'll start this evening with a presentation," she continued. "May I present Ambrogino
		  Giovanni. He has arrived just yesterday from Austria."
		-Walking onto the stage, he addressed the audience, saying, "Thank you for welcoming me
		 into your society. Though my stay here will be short, I hope to be of aid to you and
		 your Camarilla."
		-He then stepped to one side.
		-"Ambrogino Giovanni is not a member of the Camarilla, but he is an ally in good standing.
		  I have known him for many years and have myself vouched for him to the prince."
		-She then continued, saying, "There is another who is to be presented tonight." She turned
		 to Misses Gravel and Laveau in the front row of ground seats and gestured up onto stage.
		-The two walked up, and Ms. Gravel made something of a routine of it, forced-singsonging
		 her way through the formal notes of a Camarilla introduction.
		-Ms. Laveau got most of the attention, though, particularly from her clanmates, as many of
		 the Toreador stared, slack-jawed.
			-She spoke a promise of good behavior, and of loyalty to the Prince, "May her reign
			 continue for generations."
			-It was well spoken, and elicited a small golf clap from Primogen Wright, next to the
			 Prince, soon joined by the rest of our clan (myself included).
	-Following that, Prince Panhard then walked up to the stage.
		-"Unfortunately, we have a grim task before us this evening. Sheriff Hawthorn, please forward
		 the accused."
		-He ushered Ms. Barron and Mr. Nightwalker forward from backstage, and then returned there
		 himself.
		-"Mr. Nightwalker is accused of embracing Ms. Barron, without my permission or knowledge,
		 spitting on the very traditions of our Camarilla. By rights, I should have both of them
		 destroyed.
		 However, I believe this was not the fault of Ms. Barron. She was a victim of circumstances.
		 As such, she will be allowed to live. She will be bound to each of the Primogen. In ten
		 years, she will be allowed to become a member in good standing of our society.
		 As for Mr. Nightwalker, I will offer him 5 minutes. . ."
		-uproar, some looking excited, many talking
		-Starting again, the prince said, "I will offer him 5 minutes. After which all of you will
		 engage in the blood hunt. If he survives until 3:00, the hunt will be called off."
		-She then leaned forward, briefly saying something to Mr. Nightwalker, and then dramatically
		 pulled out a stop watch and started it.
		-Mr. Nightwalker looked like he wanted to say something but, looking at the prince's face,
		 he pulled his dog tags from his neck, dropped them at the feet of Ms. Barron, and then
		 jumped down from the stage.
		-He then ran down the aisle and, as he did so, tossed his phone to me. He then continued out
		 the doors and into the street.
	-As he went out the door, the theater interrupted into pandamonium, with much shouting and
	 yelling.
		-The prince, still on stage, donned a flak vest, and then began loading a shotgun.
		-Ms. Gravel, interestingly, walked over to catch the attention of Mr. Kip DuBuque, her sire,
		 and they began to talk for a few minutes.
			-Though only a row of seats away, I couldn't make out any of the words over the uproar.
		-Once Mr. DuBuque turned to walk away, toward the stage, I caught Ms. Gravel, asking her,
		 "Will you be joining us in the hunt? I mean to set a watch for Mr. Nightwalker."
		-Mr. Nier then spoke from behind me, apparently having joined us, saying, "We should look
		 for him at the observatory."
			-That mostly met blank looks from the rest of us.
		-Meanwhile, we could see quite the illustrious set of kindred gathering on the stage.
			-Their purpose became clear as Primogen Morgan opened his wrist and fed Ms. Barron her
			 blood, followed by each of the other Primogen in turn.
			-At the end of the affair, Ms. Barron exchanged a few unheard words with the prince, and
			 looked rather defeated.
		-As that wrapped up, Primogen Wright, spoke from the stage, the room quieting in response.
		 "The hunt requires action. I myself will be in the field."
		-He then lept down from the stage, and ran out the door himself.
		-Ms. Gravel turned to me, asking, "Is that the signal?"
		 "We'll certainly need to begin soon. Let's quickly collect Ms. Felicity."
		-I then walked over towards where she sat in the risers across the room.
		-She saw us coming, took the leave of her sire and walked down towards us.
		-"Concerning the matter we discussed earlier, do you wish to talk to Sheriff Hawthorn
		  further?"
		 "He didn't seem too concerned. . ."
		 "Very well. We've provided all the warning we have. We'll leave the matter in the sheriff's
		  capable hands."
		-I then pulled out my phone and began typing as I walked towards the theater doors.
			-I was messaging Mr. Horton, asking him to send me a photo of Mr. Nightwalker and to set
			 up a burner number for me, routed to my phone.
		-The others followed me to the entrance, as many other kindred also left the theater with
		 varying degrees of urgency.
		-As we exited, I turned to the others and said, "I mean to set a watch for Mr. Nightwalker,
		 using the kine. I suggest you all similarly find some way to look busy. . ."
		-Ms. Gravel spoke up, saying, "I heard he might be at a bar. . ."
		 "Then I suggest you follow up on that, Ms. Gravel. I will be starting my search here, where
		  he was last seen."
		-I then caught the attention of the first person I could on the sidewalk, asking them if
		 they'd seen "my friend" who was suffering from some "distress" and asking that they contact
		 me at the burner number if they see him, but not to approach.
			-I laced it heavily with Dominate, embedding a suggestion to do just that.
			-I then began to repeat the process with another passerby, spreading a web of eyes from
			 where Mr. Nightwalker was last seen.
			-Only after several such were sent off, shaking their heads a bit, did I take a moment
			 to message my three retainers, telling them to revoke Mr. Nightwalker's access to our
			 systems for the evening, and to let me know if they see him but not to risk themselves
			 approaching him.
		-Meanwhile, Ms. Gravel and Mr. Nier got into an uber, saying there were heading off to that
		 bar, while Ms. Felicity disappeared back into the theater.
	-At 3:30 or so, I got a call from Mr. Horton, saying that Mr. Nightwalker had arrived back at
	 the haven, and was asking for me.
	-I also, though, received a text message, calling me back to the Elysium at the theater.
		-There, it was announced that Mr. Nightwalker had survived, and had been duely pardoned.
		-Ms. Doyle, then announced that there was to be a show that she had put together.
			-The show's first act featured the Caitiff Layla as Casilda, pining after her prince in
			 a different land.
				-Casilda kept trying to reach the prince's court in increasingly strange ways,
				 emphasizing the strangeness of the court.
				-Casilda then sang a song, heavily featuring a place called "Carcossa".
					-Nothing I knew, but Ms. Gravel began to nod along.
			-In the second act, Layla's friend Cat appeared as Camilla, in the court of the prince.
				-Cat was in a ballgown wearing a mask, making exagerated efforts to remove it, and
				 then shrieking, "How dare you?" while pointing at the back of the theater.
				-As she said it, the sound of breaking glass came from the back, and all heads in
				 the theater turned.
				-There stood the prince, dressed in a white suit, and drenched in blood.
				-Blood that it soon became apparent had come from a servent that was getting up
				 from the ground, with a tray that had held refreshments.
				-The theater then erupted into a clamor, drowning out the rest of the play.
				-Prince Panhard stood, shot daggers at the mortified servant, and then stomped out of
				 the theater.
				-Seneschal D'Franco walked in from the lobby a few moments later, walked up on
				 stage, and ushered the performers off the stage, following it with an announcement.
				 "The Prince has called Elysium to a close. Please leave the theater."
				-That earned a furious look from Ms. Doyle, though the caitiff looked mostly
				 indifferent as they shuffled off back stage at the seneschal's urging.
	-As our coterie, all together save Mr. Nightwalker and Ms. Arnautovic, got up to leave, Mr.
	 Giovanni approached us, saying, "Excuse me. It's my understanding that you maintain a haven for
	 the use of the Camarilla. Would I be able to stay there while I am in the city? It will only
	 be for a short time?"
	 "It's what it's for dear," Ms. Felicity quickly responded.
	 "You have been properly introduced and welcomed into our city," I added. "We would happy to
	  welcome you.
	 "Watch out for the fish people," Mr. Nier interjected.
	-That last earned Mr. Nier a hard look, but some recognition seem to follow it, then, "Yes, the
	 fish people. . ."
	-Following that, we made our way back to the haven in a variety of vehicles, three newcomers with
	 us, Misses Laveau and Barron and Mr. Giovanni.
		-On the way back, Mr. Nightwalker's phone buzzed with a text from Mason. The screen showed
		 it's short contents: "Due to circumstances beyond my control, you're no longer welcome above
		 the bar."
	-Once back at the haven, I led Ms. Barron to Mr. Nightwalker in the apartments above.
		-When we found him, he was missing one forearm, while the other was a scaly fish arm. Looking
		 closer, his hair had grown thicker too, all around his head, forming something of a mane.
		-He stared a moment at Ms. Barron, who stared right back, wide-eyed.
		-I interrupted the silence by handing Mr. Nightwalker his phone back, saying, "You've had
		 messages."
			-He looked at it, let the phone fall from his hand, and then, with a growl of frustration,
			 swiped at the wall with his remaining clawed hand, leaving deep gouges.
		-He then turned back to me and questioned Ms. Barron's status, asking if he was allowed to
		 spend time with her.
		-"Nothing different was announced since you. . . left the theater. She's been bound, but I
		  then presume she's to be released into your care. . ."
			-The two then adjourned to one of the haven's apartments.


TODO:

The Coterie:
	-John Corelli, of Clan Brujah (played by (another) Mike):
		-Appears to be roughly 40.
		-Sounds like he has three retainers, which would be of great use to us in watching the
		 haven (potentially freeing up one of mine).
			-Yep, got that set up.
		-Has a tow truck, a tow yard to go with it, and several other vehicles in his possesion.
		-Ah, might be bowing out of the game, but will likely remain as an NPC.
	-Cadusis Nightwalker, of Clan Gangrel (played by Nate):
		-Mentioned having been a marine.
		-Referred to you during the first session as "the coteries leader by consensus". Might have
		 been a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it's a start.
		-Mason, his mentor, is a Brujah who runs a bar near the safe haven.
			-Mr. Nightwalker considers him fearsome, a veteran of the battle of New York.
		-His sire, Effie May, was the previous operator of the safe haven.
			-She fled the city under murky circumstances, leading to our inheriting the responsibility.
			-Apparently she's back now, living in Central Park, but is behaving oddly, and isn't
			 willing to talk.
			-Instead, she's making indiscrete attacks on the kine, and seems to have developed more
			 than a few spider-like feature.
		-Has a girlfriend, Ashley Barron, that he clearly cares deeply for.
			-Had? He semi-accidentally embraced her, to save her life.
			-Prince Panhard spared his life, despite embracing without permission, but is calling a
			 blood hunt for her.
			-The Prince _did_ placed him in my service, for a year and a day, as a retainer,
			 suspending his rights as a member of the Camarilla in good standing for that time.
				-Lesley noted that will also allow you to bring him place he wouldn't otherwise be
				 allowed, like Ventrue functions, as one of your retainers.
			-Ah, you indebted yourself to the Prince to save her life, and he and Ms. Barron both
			 now very much owe you (see boons, below, and TODOs before 4/28/22 session for details).
	-Sam Nier, of Clan Malkavian (played by Jake):
		-He's got academic connections, and interests in the occult and esorteric.
		-Despite his deficiencies, he has also occasional demonstrated improbable insight.
		-It seems like he's in some kind of (mortal, I think) cult, though. . .
			-Or maybe it's tied to the Kindred after all, he having later mentioned them believing
			 there were vampires among Christ's disciples.
			-Shit! The cult somehow ended up in possesion of a dirty bomb.
				-This is becoming a liability!
				-At least Mr. Nier largely seems to have dealt with the matter himself, with
				 supervision from Mr. Nightwalker. He seems to think he has the cult in hand now,
				 though you wouldn't mind personally verifying that. . .
	-Vittoria Arnautovic, of Clan Tremere (played by Til)
		-She did an impressive job of leveraging her thaumaturgical talents to intimidate someone,
		 beyond what she can actually do (I think?).
		-She was weirdly unfamiliar with the operation of her cellphone. . . Like she'd never used
		 one.
			-Yep, I learned she spent a lot of the recent past in torpor, since The Battle of New York.
		-She was in the Sabbat, or at least (she claims) a deep cover agent within it.
			-She professes loyalty to The Camarilla and Clan Tremere, then and now, and at least
			 _current_ loyalty to The Camarilla was publicly forced from her by a discipline using
			 Primogen Wright.
			-The Board told you of this, and asked you to protect her secret, naming her a valuable
			 source of intelligence for the sect.
				-They also asked you to extend this understanding to any of the coterie that also
				 discover her past, though none yet have.
	-"Gravel", of Clan Nosferatu (played by Ash)
		-Poor taste in friends, given that she seems to have once been. . . friendly with Mr. Van
		 Buren.
		-Her roommate, Ms. Hill seemed rather surly too, though it sounds like she possesses some
		 interesting, and perhaps arcane, talents. . .
		-Prince Panhard referred to her as Ms. Brukulin (spelling?).
		-Her sire is Mr. Kip DuBuque.
	-Felicity TODO, of Clan Toreador (played by Mike):
		-(Ex?) stripper.
		-Her sire is Ms. Dawn Fadel, and she has one brood sister, Ms. Tessa Laveau.


Boons owed to you:
	-Kelly Haley, a Malkavian:
		-Minor boon: You and your coterie fetched those boxes from that Times Square storage unit.
	-Mr. Cadusis Nightwalker, your coteriemate:
		-Minor boon: You had Mr. Horton train Mr. Nightwalker in some technology skills.
		-Major boon: You intervened with Prince Panhard, indebting yourself to her, to save the
					 (un)life of his girlfriend, Ms. Barron.
	-Ms. Ashley Barron, of Clan Gangrel: 
		-Life boon: You intervened with Prince Panhard, indebting yourself to her, to save Ms.
					Barron's (un)life.
Boons owed: 
	-Morgan Durley, the Tremere Primogen:
		-2 pt. boon:
			-You formally requested and were granted permission to operate your "blood testing"
			 research startup, it being adjacent to the Tremere Primogen's domain of hospitals,
			 blood banks, and emergency services.
	-Kenneth Wright, the Ventrue Primogen:
		-2 pt. boon:
			-For the introduction that made the above boon possible, and his assistance in winning
			 a favorable deal there.
	-Reece Dooley, your sire:
		-2 pt. boon:
			-Though the Kindred of your city and Clan very much hold him responsible for his childe,
			 you very much feel indebted to your sire for your agoge (Ventrue post-Embrace training
			 period), something your sire very much encouraged. He created you for a reason, after
			 all. He means to see a return on his investment, and that no shame is brought to him.
			 You, meanwhile, see the potential for much dignitas in repaying, rather than shirking,
			 a debt you didn't exactly sign yourself up for.
	-Prince Helen Panhard, of New York City:
		-Major boon: You begged a favor of her as a clanmate to save the (un)life of Ms. Barron.

			"Mr. Nielsen told me that there are many who hate him for what he is, rival factions of his kind and fanatics among them, and informed me of the major security breach you're referring to," Mr. Horton says, adding that, "He asked me to ensure that all surveillance and alarm systems be run on air gapped networks, and that any recordings made be kept encrypted, and kept for a minimal duration, usually 24 hours or less, before secure destruction."
			"Our plan is to install cameras monitoring the elevator and hallway. Given the purpose of this facility, the apartments will be unmonitored, and we ask that you and your. . . kin keep anything that shouldn't be seen confined to them."
			_(On that last point, @DMJake#5594, I think you also get a quick talk from Mr. Nielsen, requesting that you maintain the Masquerade even in the common spaces of the haven, reserving anything that would violate that for the more private apartments.)_
			"Oh, and Mr. Nielsen has also asked me to do the usual evaluation of the floor's fire suppression systems, doing what I can to improve them myself. If something more extensive is required, we'll see about finding some discrete contractors, but we'll avoid that if we can."
