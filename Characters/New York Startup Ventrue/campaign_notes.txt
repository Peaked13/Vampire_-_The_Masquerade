Pregame stuff:
	-The social scene:
		-More aware of this than anyone else, but night 1 stuff for a Ventrue.
		-Harpies:
			-Handouts will be in Roll20 soon (for you).
			-Head is Malkavian painter / art historian.
		-You've been to a salon, unofficial Elysium-alikes hosted by various Harpies.
			-If no kine, no need for Masquerade.
			-Again if no kine, can get away with things like using disciplines on other kindred
			 that would not be allowable at Elysium.
				-Reason, maybe, to get invited to one or even set one up, if you want to get away
				 with something like that on Kindred (or even coterie members).
	-Write up specific goals for character or game, and give to Lesley.
		-In-Character goals:
			-Find an enduring place for yourself in Kindred society before your knowledge of the
			 moment runs thin.
			-Find your route to prominence, prestige, and power in a world where the competition's
			 headstart is measured in millenia. Fortunately, everything in your existance thus far
			 has prepared you to profit from "disruption."
		-Personal goals:
			-Explore the Social Abilities and Disciplines.
			-Explore Camarilla politics, and the tension of being a neonate in a methuselah's world.
				-The latter is a good bit of what I'm going for with the notion of Mr. Nielsen being
				 embraced for tech expertise and trying to find an enduring place for himself, surfing
				 the new developments of the kine.
			-Play around with Backgrounds.
