Pregame stuff:
	-The social scene:
		-More aware of this than anyone else, but night 1 stuff for a Ventrue.
		-Harpies:
			-Handouts will be in Roll20 soon (for you).
			-Head is Malkavian painter / art historian.
		-You've been to a salon, unofficial Elysium-alikes hosted by various Harpies.
			-If no kine, no need for Masquerade.
			-Again if no kine, can get away with things like using disciplines on other kindred
			 that would not be allowable at Elysium.
				-Reason, maybe, to get invited to one or even set one up, if you want to get away
				 with something like that on Kindred (or even coterie members).
	-Write up specific goals for character or game, and give to Lesley.
		-In-Character goals:
			-Find an enduring place for yourself in Kindred society before your knowledge of the
			 moment runs thin.
			-Find your route to prominence, prestige, and power in a world where the competition's
			 headstart is measured in millenia. Fortunately, everything in your existance thus far
			 has prepared you to profit from "disruption."
		-Personal goals:
			-Explore the Social Abilities and Disciplines.
			-Explore Camarilla politics, and the tension of being a neonate in a methuselah's world.
				-The latter is a good bit of what I'm going for with the notion of Mr. Nielsen being
				 embraced for tech expertise and trying to find an enduring place for himself, surfing
				 the new developments of the kine.
			-Play around with Backgrounds.
	-The Camarilla has some concerns around electronics, and their risk of breaking The Masquerade:
		-Discussed in chat here: https://discord.com/channels/930231429286207539/930231429286207542/938566003657408592
		-Talking to Lesley, you've gotten the dispensation required, given what you've built your
		 (un)life around and what you provide.
	-It's more or less the current date, and COVID is a thing.
		-In 2005, a kind of Camarilla social network, thought to be one of the most secure of it's
		 kind in existence, was hacked. The locations of many havens were exposed to a group calling
		 itself "The Second Inquisition", resulting in these kine destroying many Kindred.
			-The biggest loss was the newly awakened Prince of London, Mithras, rumored to have been
			 millenia old.
			-This led to a backlash against technology in The Camarilla, and a ban on the use social
			 media without permission.
				-As mentioned above, you've received that dispensation.
		-It's been 20 years since the doomsday cultists of The Sabbat were driven from New York City.
			-Calebros later stepped down, in 2005, refusing to continue as Prince, though he still
			 lives in the city's sewers somewhere, contributing to unusual Nosferatu political
			 prominence to this day.
				-Severl of the Primogen he named are still in place too, the Brujah, Malkavian, and
				 Nosferatu Primogens, with their clans taking on unusual prominence in the city.
				-That came at the cost of the usually on top, Ventrue and Toreador in particular,
				 with the Toreador taking it hardest.
					-Their Primogen, in particular, seethes about the subject, and is always eager to
		-Prince Hellene Panhard has ruled the city since 2005.
			-Made in 1999, she's the childe of a former Prince of NYC, the one, in fact, who ruled
			 from it's founding until it's loss to The Sabbat.
			-Seen as something of a libral, she has even made treaties with the anarchs in The Bronx.
			-She is also instrumental in keeping The Sabbat out of the city, by means of a formidable
			 spy network. Most assume she has Federal connections.


2/2/22: It Began on a Twosday. . .
	-Elysium this evening was called by it's Keeper, Tony Perez, who contacted me through Ms. Veck.
		-He said that we'd lost a member of The Camarilla tonight.
		-My sire and I were thus chatting while looking around avidly, trying to see who's missing.
			-A Gangrel ancillae seemed to be missing, but I could not put a name to his face. . .
		-My clanmates also talked amongst themselves about on TODO (asian name), who is seeking to
		 embrace his secretary.
			-He has heavy interested in construction companies.
		-I also overheard a nearby table say that their friend "Evelyn" did not make it, and one of
		 them was even weeping over it.
			-They're caitiff.
			-I decided to approach the table, asking the weeping one, "What's the matter was, Ms. . ."
				-Shockingly, as I approached, I realized those were regular tears running down her
				 face, and she took a drink from a glass of water in front of her.
				-She said that her friend had been missing for weeks.
				-The whole affair elicited jeers from a Brujah at the other table, saying that no
				 one cares about the problems of these thinbloods, she's not really even one of us.
					-His fellows had to calm him, with mixed success, warning him against starting
					 a fight in Elysium.
				-Ignoring the Brujah, another of the caitiff asked me, "What do you care about our
				 problems?"
				 "I heard someone in distress, and wondered if there was any help I could offer."
				-That elicited a snort.
				-Another at the table then spoke up: "Hey! He's offering to _help_ Cat. Lay off."
				 "You want to help?" he responded, "Come down to the pier sometime, see what
				  bullshit we put up with."
				 "I would love to. Here, take my contact info," I said, handing him my card.
				-A dog also joined us, to match Ms. Cat. A well dressed Kindred, but clearly a
				 Gangrel by his yellow, cat-slit eyes, came over to express his sympathies as well,
				 also indicating that he makes it his business to find people.
					-I exchanged introductions and contact information with Mr. Cadusis, expressing
					 that finding people was a very useful talent indeed.
		-As the night went on, the sheriff, Garrett Hawthorn, began to collect several kindred, my
		 sire among them, bringing them over to the Primogen.
		-Eventually, he also asked that the assembled Kindred return to their seats, as the Prince
		 came out and Garrett began to  address the assembled.
			-He acknowledged that there had been disappearances of thinblooded in the city. He also
			 said he'd already told us all this, and so this was a warning too, to quit making a
			 scene in Elysium about it.
			-He then moved on to what seemed to be his main business, mentioning a letter saying
			 that a Gangrel, Ellie May, would no longer be in the city.
				-She had looked after an important safehouse in the city, one open to all of us in
				 an emergency. That responsibility is now left vacant.
			-As such, a new coterie is to be established, to look after this haven.
			-He then asked for Sam Nier, Cadusis Nightwalker, and myself to step forward.
				-He spoke of us as promising, and trusted, neonate, and said we would thus be
				 entrusted with this task.
		-Prince Panhard then spoke up, saying there was another reason we'd all been called here.
			-"The Sabbat," she said, "are in the state again. There's been fighting in Rochester,
			 and as of tonight, Rochester is once again in Sabbat hands."
				-This caused the expected murmering from those assembled.
			-"We do not wish to cause panic. We have not seen numbers that would suggest a threat
			  to New York.
			  Rochester was left intentionally open, to gauge their strength if they returned to the
			  state. The city fell to only a single pack. Unfortunate, but no threat to our city.
			  I believe we can retake it.
			  In the meantime, I want everyone stay out of Staten Island. I am also giving a special
			  dispensation to our sheriff, to designate what deputies he will, to keep the Sabbat
			  out of our city. If he asks for your help, give it.
			  Now, enjoy the rest of the evening."
		-At that, Tony Perez called out, saying that drinks are free for the rest of the night, and
		 music began.
		-Sitting back down at my table, I recieved reserved Ventrue congratulations, then the rest
		 of the clan slowly trickled out.
		-Garrett them approached me, asking me to follow him, handing me a set of keys: "These are
		 the master keys for 13th floor of the Lancaster building in Hell's Kitchen. A presence
		 there is needed at all times. See to it. I was told you could be entrusted in this. Your
		 sire spoke highly of you. Officially, Mr. Wright's name is on the lease (the Ventrue
		 Primogen). If you need anything, or something happens. Call me. Also, I'm deputizing you.
		 You do not want to let me down."
		-He then went off to speak with Mr. Nightwalker, followed by a brief exchange with Mr. Nier,
		 Garrett grimacing through the whole thing with the latter.
		-While Garrett talked with Mr. Nier, I talked to Cadusis, remarking that we'd made each
		 other's acquaintence again sooner than I'd anticipated.
			-I also asked about this clanmate of his, whose job we'd be taking over. Did he know her?
			-He briefly indicated yes, but said that we shouldn't talk of the matter here.
		-Mr. Nier then approached the two of us.
			-"Here," he said to me, "Have my card."
			 He pulled something from his lapel, handing it to me. I took it reflexively, only to
			 look in horror at the gray beard hair he had handed me."
			-Noticing my reaction, he babled something about many cultures respecting the wisdom in
			 the beards of the aged.
			 "Is that any area of interest to you, then?" I asked, ". . . Anthropology?"
			 "Yes, yes. I have connections in many of the city's universities, and a diverse set of
			  esoteric interests. . ."
		-As we talked, a woman named Kelly Haley called to us, and asked for a favor.
			-"I was asked to get a couple boxes from a storage unit here in town, but, um, the guy
			  won't let me into the unit. I. . . get really angry, when he talks to me like that. . ."
			 "We would be happy to help," I responded, "We wouldn't want there to be a scene. . ."
			-The others chimed in, responding affirmatively.
			-"The storage unit is near Times Square, in a really tall building fronted with black glass."
			 Mr. Nightwalker: "What's in these boxes?"
			 "I don't know."
			 Mr. Nightwalker: "How do we recognize them, then?"
			 ". . . It's the boxes. The boxes in the storage unit?"
			-Mr. Nightwalker then took out a notepad and asked her a number of detailed questions,
			 but without much luck. Best he got was, "I don't know. It tastes like. . . mustard?"
				-Turning to Mr. Nier, she said, "You know what I'm talking about, right?"
					-I suspect they're clanmates.
	-We then discussed our next move.
		-Elysium is in midtown, the Lancaster building in Hell's Kitchen, and the storage unit in
		 Times Square.
		-Misters Nier and Nightwalker were interested in checking out the storage unit first, but I
		 argued the Sheriff would not look kindly upon delay. Unless they knew the building already,
		 it would be best to work on that in parallel.
		-We settled on heading straight to the Lancaster building. I said I'll have a car brought
		 around, though Mr. Nier said he had one as well.
		-I then headed outside, pulled out a phone and reinserted it's battery, and then called Mr.
		 Hubbard, to have him bring the car around.
		-Mr. Nightwalker arrived as I was still on the phone, and protested that we could take his
		 car, but I said my staff would be joining us as well, and that we'd follow him.
	-Arriving at the Lancaster, we headed up to the 13th floor, finding a whole floor of empty
	 apartments, with the key I was given opening apparently every door.
		-As we entered, I asked Mr. Hubbard to give the place a once over, see what we're dealing
		 with. Mr. Nightwalker joined him in that.
		-After some time, the two of them completed the sweep.
			-Each of the modest apartments was identical in floorplan, empty aside from basic
			 furnishings.
			-In each, the table held a set of keys opening only the apartment's own door, as well
			 as some paperwork, listing the aparment's contents and asking any staying there to
			 sign the document.
			-The apartments lack windows, and the floor has only one entrance, the elevator at the
			 North end of the hall. No fire escapes or stairs or in evidence.
				-The elevator had needed a key to reach the 13th floor, too.
				-Concrete floors and ceilings too, beneath whatever coverings.
				-This place was clearly modified for the purposes of our kind. . .
		-Mr. Nightwalker also brought up that we're not far from Smith's Bar, an establishment run
		 by his ally, a Brujah called Mason, and that his haven was upstairs there.
			-Mr. Nier also volunteered that he has a haven "part of which can survive a nuclear blast."
				-"Oh? And where is this place?" I asked.
				 "Perhaps you've heard of Mega Beans? It's a coffeshop?"
				-I also asked him a bit about himself, what our esteemed prince expected him to contribute.
					-"My charm, I suppose? Some warmth. Also my. . . insights into the coming events."
					 "Coming events?"
					 "Well, I'm concerned about our security for a reason. . ."
					-Bit of a paranoid, sounds like. I can work with that, though.
		-I asked Ms. Veck to, in the next day, run a quick property search, and pull related
		 documents: "This place is supposed to be in Mr. Wright's name, so I'm sure it's all in
		 order, but it's best to be sure."
		-Mr. Nightwalker offered to arrange the delivery of supplies discretely, a useful capability.
		-Mr. Nier also babeled a bit about supplies he had for "the coming day when all this paper
		 in our wallets becomes useless."
	-Mr. Nier then left for his haven, with us all agreeing we'd meet back here at nightfall.
	-Mr. Nightwalker retrieved some supplies from his car, flashbangs, tear gas, and masks for the
	 ghouls.
		-There was a laptop as well, one the he claimed was carefully secured, mentioning a
		 "Schreknet", and routing through his haven.
		-I referred him to Mr. Horton where the weapons were concerned, and the two of them
		 conferred, discussing how to deploy them.
		-He also gave me another card, different from the first, for a "House of Sinatrix", a fetish
		 dungeon. He said that was his haven nearby, and where his laptop routed through.
	-Waking the next night, my retainers reported no incidents, nor messages requiring my urgent
	 attention.
		-Waking being Mr. Horton and Mr. Hubbard's shift change, I took the opportunity to ask Mr.
         Horton to see to the place's security.
			-He mentioned installing both cameras and reinforced doors. I made sure to insist the
			 cameras be on an airgapped network, with encrypted local storage.
			-I also claimed the apartment in the NE corner of the building for myself.
		-I then spoke with Ms. Veck, asking her to search out the black glass building Ms. Haley had
		 mentioned.
			-In short order, she had found one candidate, a highrise matching the description with
			 a warehouse in the building.
			-That warehouse storage area is owned by "Panacea Pharmaceuticals".
	-Mr. Nier soon returned too.
		-He requested a moment of my time, describing a cop poking around "his" coffee, looking for
		 a missing person.
		-I asked him if he "knew anything" about the disappearance himself, which he claimed not to,
		 but he still did not want the attention.
		-Talking to him further, he claimed to possess talents that would allow him to manipulate
		 the officers memories, to send him off the trail, and just needed to get some time alone
		 with him.
		-I helped him strategize an approach for doing that, setting up and interview at the coffee
		 shop, posing as an employee who may have seen something.
			-You resisted getting personally invovled, though, still unsure of Mr. Nier and not
			 wanting to entangle yourself with a disappearance.
	-Mr. Nightwalker ran some errands, but, on his return, he reported running into some new Kindred
	 in the city.
		-Middle Easterners, they made their presence known at Mason's bar, and were asking about the
		 Tremere.
		-TODO: follow up with sheriff about that
	-I also took this opportunity to ask Mr. Nightwalker about Ellie May.
		-Turns out she's his sire, but he doesn't know why she has left the city.
		-She was always erratic, though, which is why much of his education came from Mason.
		-"What was she to Mason?" I then asked.
		 "Let's say they had a. . . working relationship. The sheriff now says I'm even deader if If
		  try to leave too."
	-We then decided to do some research into Panacea Pharmaceuticals.
		-It's a subsidiary of another company, Mastodon, also pharmaceutical focused.
		-We did find a contact number, though.
	-We ultimately decided to pose as OSHA inspectors. Ms. Veck through together some forged
	 paperwork, and made the call.
		-We got something set up, but we were still rather unsure of how we'd identify the package
		 in question.
			-Ms. Haley had seemed to be confident Mr. Nier could identify it, but he seemed only
			 somewhat confident.
			-So, he ran off to Mr. Nightwalker's car, to "think" on it.
			-By the time we came to join him, we found him rocking in the back seat, having chewed
			 all of his fingernails off.
	-We drove to the building, and Ms. Veck talked our way inside.
		-We got an escorted tour of the facility, while a concealed Mr. Nier trailed along, looking
		 for our goal.
		-Eventually he sent me a text, indicating a nearby door. We asked our escort to open it, and
		 Mr. Nier was soon back in the car with the box. We found him reading a notebook he'd pulled
		 from it as we returned there ourselves.
		-We then delivered it to Ms. Haley, meeting her again at Elysium, who's now indebted to the three
		 of us for a minor boon.
	-I also took a moment to reach out to Sheriff Hawthorn, alerting him to the strangers in town.
		-He was apparently aware of them, though, as they'd properly alerted the Prince to their
		 presence.


TODO:
	-Follow up on the missing caitiff, Ms. Cat's friend.
	-You're already at the point you could be spending some XP.
