		-
	-A hacker and social engineer, turned pro. She learned how to get the same trickster thrills
	 _and_ get paid, getting a series of tech jobs, getting good at office politics, and eventually
	 getting a law degree. It all turned out it was all the same fun as fucking with telco employees
	 when she was 15 was.
	-Eventually, at a work function, she met someone who that took what she did with people and turned
	 it up to _11_. She had to know how he did it. Now that she does, she's hooked.
	-She serves as a kind of seneschal.

	Alternate Identity: 1
		-In a past private "security" gig, he heard about someone who could put together a backup
		 identity, in case things went South. He never ended up in a very _public_ messs, so he

		 empty bank accounts, and other documents.
	Contacts: 2
		Major Contacts: 
			-Private security recruiter:
				-They worked together in the past. Can help with who to hire, and perhaps even more
				 interesting, who's _hiring_ in the area.
			-Theft ring member:
				-Another old coworker, one who decided the outright criminal paid even better.
				-Might have word of weird stuff being shipped into the city and the like.
				-Also serves as a way to get information _out_. Stuff like, "There's something
				 valuable in this truck," or even, "There's someone _here_ who would pay good money
				 for the contents of that truck."
