Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-A hacker and social engineer, turned pro. She learned how to get the same trickster thrills
	 _and_ get paid, getting a series of tech jobs, getting good at office politics, and eventually
	 getting a law degree. It turned out it was all the same fun as fucking with telco employees
	 when she was 15.
		-Good inspiration for her mindset, though there was probably less sex and trauma for Ms.
		 Veck, given how thoroughly straight she went: https://www.theverge.com/c/22889425/susy-thunder-headley-hackers-phone-phreakers-claire-evans
	-Eventually, at a work function, she met someone who took what she did with people and turned
	 it up to _11_. She had to know how he did it. Now that she does, she's hooked.
	-She serves as a kind of seneschal, and takes the most active roll in Mr. Nielsen's companies
	 out of all of the retainers, sitting on their boards, fielding daylight inquiries, etc.

Equipment:
	-Cellphone running Horton's customized Android build.
		-Adapter cables, for connecting the cellphone to all sorts of devices.
	-Laptop

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-Tall and thin, with short brown hair.
	-Bob Horton served in the army in Afghanistan, and then used the tuition assistance to fund a
	 computer engineering degree and launch a career in information security.
		-Maybe was a Signal Support Systems Specialist?
			-https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/career-match/signal-intelligence/locations-stats-frequencies/25u-signal-support-systems-specialist.html
	-Several years ago, he was recruited by a "high-speed video signal processing" startup that was
	 spending lavishly on it's internal secruity and the security of the product (talking lots about
	 potential Federal applications).
	-In fact, it was spending lavishly on all _sorts_ of things. The pay was great, even if you
	 ignored the options. Bob certainly _did_ ignore them, as he couldn't see how the place would
	 _ever_ turn a profit before it ran out of investment capital.
	-That is until Bob met one of the board members, at a catered dinner after work one night. Mr.
	 Nielsen gave a talk about the company's future and potential that received no less than three
	 standing ovations. It had Bob sold, and Mr. Nielsen surrounded by people clammoring for his
	 attention.
	-Mr. Nielsen, though, spent most of the rest of the event talking to Bob. After a brief word
	 to a few of the company's exectutives, he pushed through the crowd and approached Bob. He
	 seemed to know quite a bit about Bob, actually, and peppered him with questions, not only about
	 his work here, but also about Bob's personal life and his past career, both civilian and military.
	-It felt to Bob a lot like a job interview and, enthralled by Mr. Nielsen, he very much wanted
	 whatever the job was. Soon, he found he'd followed Mr. Nielsen back to another office nearby,
	 and, with a cocktail Mr. Nielsen had mixed for him, they were toasting a "long and prosperous
	 future together."
	-Bob serves now as a bodyguard and secruity consultant for Mr. Nielsen, employeed by a small IT
	 security consultancy that Mr. Nielsen mantains majority control over.
		-The consultant job not only pays Bob's bills, but provides cover for all sorts of things,
		 under the umbrella of "penetration testing."
	-He's pretty friendly with Mr. Nightwalker. Mr. Horton did some technology training for him at
	 my behest and they both share a military background.

Equipment:
	-Cellphone running Horton's customized Android build.
		-Adapter cables, for connecting the cellphone to all sorts of devices.
	-Lock pick set, including a vibrating lock pick.
	-Swiss Army Knife (Cybertool)
	-Laptop
	-Some subset of (depending on the dress code or danger of an occasion, or liklihood of search):
		-Heavy Pistol (V20 Core pg. 281, Dmg: 5, Rng. 25, Rate: 3, Cap: 13+1, Conceal J)
		-Kevlar Vest (V20 Core pg. 280, Armor 3, Penalty 1)
		-Reinforced Clothing (V20 Core pg. 280, Armor 1, Penalty 0)
			-Under the Kevlar, protecting the rest of the body.

		-2x Wooden Stake (V20 Core pg. 280, Strength+1, Conceal T)
		-Semi-auto Shotgun (V20 Core pg. 281, Dmg: 8, Rng. 20, Rate: 3, Cap: 6+1, Conceal T)
	-On specific occasions, otherwise stored:
		-Rifle with scope (V20 Core pg. 281, Dmg: 8, Rng. 200, Rate: 1, Cap: 3+1, Conceal N)
			-Scope adds additional dice when aiming. See V20 Core pg. 277.

				-Might have word of weird stuff being shipped into the city and the like.
				-Also serves as a way to get information _out_. Stuff like, "There's something

				 for the contents of that truck."

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-Mr. Hubbard served in the marines, in Iraq and Afghanistan both, joining right out of high
	 school.
	-Though he found many kindred spirits in the military, among the less. . .  squeamish set, it
	 was also clear he'd never be making rank. Too many fights, and other trouble, on his record.
	-As such, he started looking for another option for a raise. A few abortive attempts at
	 smuggling and looting contributed to that trouble-on-record, and, once his current tour of
	 duty was up, Mr. Hubbard mustered out and followed several of his friends in joining up with a
	 private military contractor.
	-There he truly thrived, with laxer rules and much better pay. Clients also loved that he very
	 much looked the part and made quite the impression on whatever trouble they were worried about.
	-While in between contracts, he was called into the company's offices for inspection by a
	 prospective client, a part of the sales process he'd already participated in several times
	 before.
	-There, he met Mr. Nielsen for the first time. Mr. Nielsen already seemed to know quite a bit
	 about Mr. Hubbard personally, a fact that seemed to surprise the sales rep, and he asked Mr.
	 Hubbard a variety of questions about his past service, both with the company and in the marines.
	-Mr. Hubbard thought that Mr. Nielsen must not have liked the answers because, despite
	 requesting Mr. Hubbard's number for "any further questions", Mr. Hubbard got word the next
	 night that the client would not be proceeding with the contract.
	-That is until he got a call from Mr. Nielsen a week later, asking to meet with him again.
	-There, Mr. Nielsen outlined a job offer for Mr. Hubbard personally, saying he, "Preferred to
	 employ most of his staff directly." The pay was substantially more than his already
	 outrageously high salary, and the work apparently here in New York, but, even so, Mr. Hubbard
	 was cautious.
	 "The company. . . doesn't like it's contractors cutting them out," Mr Hubbard demurred.
	 "That will not be an issue here. I've already spoken with a member of the company's board, one
	  Mr. Dougalas, and he has assured me that it will not be an issue. He was actually the one who
	  recommended you. In return, I've offered him certain considerations, mostly the opportunity
	  to participate in a private round of investment in a company he's very excited about."
	 "Well, if I can confirm that with my higher ups, that salary _is_ awfully hard to say no to. . ."
	 "If you live up to the recommendation, that's just the beginning of the rewards on offer to
	  you. . . Here. Check with your employers and then call this number to speak with my assistant,
	  Ms. Veck. She'll get you set up."
	-The new job proved to be quite easy, mostly entailing being Mr. Nielsen's bodyguard during the
	 evening.
	-Mr. Nielsen, though, he was quite impressed by, and also by the various start ups he was
	 involved in, even if he couldn't quite put his finger on why. The idea of being involved with
	 the whole thing in any capacity was quite exciting.
	-In particular, being no stranger to. . . performance enhancement, Mr. Hubbard was fascinated
	 by the hints Mr. Nielsen dropped about something his bloodwork start-up had been putting
	 together. "Somewhat like blood doping, like cyclists do," Mr. Nielsen described it, and Mr.
	 Hubbard asked to try it several times before it before he was allowed to do so.
	-The rush, and the power, had Mr. Hubbard quickly hooked, and he was surprisingly little phased
	 when the source of it was really explained to him, even if it took a demonstration before he'd
	 believe it.
