		Clanbook Slubri pg. 47
	Odd Eye (2 pt. flaw)
		Clanbook Slubri pg. 47
		Red
	Enemy (5 pt. flaw)
		Essentially the entirety of Clan Tremere, on account of being a Salubri, and many others willing to believe
		their propaganda.

Freebie points (15)
	Are "Powers of the Blooding" available for freebie points?
		Clanbook Slubri pg. 44
		Cost is listed in XP (which also suggests using freebie points might not be a great *deal*)
		If it's possible, get at least Tracker's Mark, and maybe the other
			Presence 5 _is_ crazy good
	If not, get Valern to 4, and maybe healer Valern
		You could possibly drop Blooding by the Code, depending on Storyteller discussion of availability of it's perks.
