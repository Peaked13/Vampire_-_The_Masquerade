Merits & Flaws: (+3 Freebie Points)
	Repulsed by Garlic (1 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 301):
		-You cannot abide garlic and the scent will drive you from a room unless you succeed on a
		 Willpower roll with difficulty based on the strength of the odor.
	Vulnerability to Silver (2 pt. Flaw, Guide to the Sabbat pg. 95):
		-Silver weapons deal aggravated to you, and the mere touch of silver discomfits you.
	Potential extras, depending on game:
		New Arrival (1 pt. Flaw, Guide to the Camarilla pg. 77):
			-Potentially appropriate for using this character in a Camarilla game where you're
			 claiming to be a newly arrived Caitiff.
		Dark Secret (1 pt. Flaw, Core pg. 300):
			-Also very appropriate for a Camarilla game, given that you're Sabbat
		-Points from the above, both suited to a Camarilla game, should probably go to dots in
		 the Alternate Identity background, to tie the whole thing together and put you on a
		 somewhat solid footing.
