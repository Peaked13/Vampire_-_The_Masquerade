Merits & Flaws:
	Ambidexterous (1 pt. Merit, Core pg. 296):
		-No penalty for using your off hand, helping the use of two weapons.
	Disgrace to the Blood (3 pt. Flaw, Guide to The Camarilla pg. 78)
		-Your sire was (unknown to you) tricked into embracing you. She made a go of it, probably
		 intent on saving face, but eventually grew fed up, and publicly renounced you, cutting her
		 losses.
	New Kid (1 pt. Flaw, Guide to The Camarilla pg. 77)
		-"All Social-related rolls are +1 difficulty when you are dealing with other neonates."
		-The latest embracee aspect of it is less important than emphasizing just how big a geek
		 your peers view you as. They're perhaps especially sensitive to it, being recently mortal
		 themselves, compared to some 700-year-old fossil who has no idea what the M:tG collection
		 you keep going on about even is.
	Stereotype (2 pt. Flaw, Guide to The Camarilla pg. 74)
		-"+2 difficult to Social rolls with other vampires who don't share your habits"
		-You're _way_ too excited about this all. You were already inclined to wear a cloak around
		 town as a mortal and that's only gotten worse. If you don't look like you're on your way
		 to a LARP, you dress like Blade. Being a pudgy white guy, though, it comes off a bit more
		 mall ninja.

Freebie points: 20 (15 + 5 for Merits & Flaws)

Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-You look like 21 from The Venture Brothers.
	-As a mortal:
		-SCA nerd.
	-Your sire spotted you at an art gallery event that featured a medieval fencing demonstration
	 you did.
		-(Andy definitely has something he personally went to in mind here.)
		-She had been there for other reasons.
			-Since she already had permission to embrace someone, perhaps she was observing her
			 _intended_ target?
		-Two local Kindred, a Ventrue and a Toreador, showed up to the event, but ignored her.
			-"Those two have seen me around before. That Ventrue prick XXXX definitely knows me."
			-"This is a snub! It's gotta be a snub. . ."
		-They wandered the gallery, talking, and ended up standing near your sire for your fencing
		 demonstration.
			-You were genuinely good at it, and your sire overheard XXXX comment on it approvingly,
			 even remarking that he'd like to pursue your embrace.
			-Your sire overheard that, and, later that night, did something rash, to avenge the
			 snub, and generally stick it to "that Ventrue asshat".
	-Your sire was tricked into embracing you.
		-This fact is unknown to you, though someone a bit less oblivious might have figured it out.
		-She made a go of it, probably intent on saving face, but eventually grew fed up, and
		 publicly renounced you, cutting her losses.
			-You're hurt, but you're not really _mad_ at her. You still think your "sexy vampire
			 chick" is super cool. (She has to be restrained from strangling you.)
	-Your mentor is XXXX, the Ventrue who tricked your sire.
		-Fairly old, he was embraced when the Ventrue were still Teutonic marcher lords, waging
		 nightly war against the Tzimisce of Eastern Europe.
		-He genuinely was impressed by your fencing, and knows the subject well.
			-He'd actually seen it before the night of your embrace, his whole ploy being thoroughly
			 premeditated.
		-You had potential as a sparring partner, something he'd lacked for nearly a century.
		-Despite that skill with a blade still having relevance to current nights, if no longer to
		 current days, you manifestly _did not_ have potential as a childe.
			-It took only a very brief interaction with you to see you could never be a Ventrue.
		-However, he saw another use for you. Perhaps he could have his sparring partner, and a
		 useful soldier, all at no cost to him while shaming a rival to boot. . .
		-Having successfully executed his plan, XXXX didn't have to wait long before you had
		 infuriated your sire and become a mockery among the local Kindred, after which he swooped
		 in.
			-He got what he wanted from you, and credit from the local Kindred as well, for looking
			 after someone else's mistake and making sure you don't threaten The Masquerade.
			-You, meanwhile, are eager to please, glad of the help and attention, especially after
			 the rejection by your sire.
				-You think XXXX is just the coolest, you're thrilled by the tidbits of, "When I was
				 mortal. . ." Medieval trivia he drops you, and love "roleplaying" the role of a
				 fuedal sworn sword with this actual dark ages (vampire!) noble.
				-That said, while he has you wrapped around his finger, you _do_ get real benefit
				 from the relationship. It's where you knowledge of Fortitude, and most of your
				 knowledge of The Camarilla, came from, and you've grown as a swordsman, particular
				 in the direction of more. . . practical application.
					-XXXX may view you as a tool, but he believes in keeping his tools sharp, and
					 and knows these little gifts bind you all the closer to him.
	-Nerd rage!
	-You make a living (your Resources) from nerd stuff online. Running a games blog, miniature
	 painting services, selling terrain pieces, etc.
		-Your Crafts, Professional Skill, and Computer abilities all factor into it.
		-It's easily maintained in your new unlife.
