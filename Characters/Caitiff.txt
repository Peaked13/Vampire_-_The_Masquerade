Character Description and Background:
	-Appearance:
		-
	-As a mortal:
		-High school and college athelete.
			-Played football.
			-Used to being popular.
			-Effectively, had status as a mortal, and resultingly felt charismatic.
		-Embraced shortly out of college.
	-Embraced by a sire who disappeared the next night.
		-Said he'd be coming back, but never returned to the apartment in which you both had holed up.
		-You had met him at a bar.
		-A few nights later, after "nursing" a beer there for hours each night, hoping to see him,
		 again, you instead saw a woman you thought he had been with the night you two met.
		-After getting across to her what you were, she immediately pulled you aside, down the
		 hall towards the kitchen.
		-She told you your sire was dead, but wouldn't say more.
		-Your sire had given you the bare basics about the fact that you're a vampire, in the night
		 you had together.
		-In 30 minutes, she told you what the Camarilla is, that you should present yourself to a
		 prince in a new city. She also told you you need to never come back here and to get the fuck
		 out of town (". . . or you'll be seeing your sire soon after all.").
			-She seemed frightened.
		-It was only later that you learned to think it odd that neither mentioned clan, though they
		 may have just been in a hurry.
	-(Un)life since has been rough.
		-You've drifted from city to city, as your welcome wears out.
		-As a caitiff, and one still ignorant of many important things, you're not the popular, well
		 liked person you'd been as a mortal.
		-You're scorned, and regularly subject to abuse.
		-You've definitely been changed by the experience.
			-Low charisma (now), relative to manipulation. You're unsure and shy these days, but
			 have learned to lie when you have to, to survive.
			-Your disciplines and merits reflect this, focusing on sensing danger and hiding.
				-You overheard an acquaintance decribe you as more prey than predator. It was
				 meant cruely, and did hurt, but you have to admit it rings a little true.
	-You've got a job, as a tech contractor.
		-You worked in tech after college.
		-After you were embraced, you reached out to a friend who worked as a contractor, telling
		 him you needed something that allowed remote work and a flexible schedule.
			-You sounded pretty desperate, and he pointed you in the right direction.
		-It lets you travel freely and keep up your resources as you do.
	-You've got a car.

Equipment (stuff to start with or obtain):
	

Advancement:
	-Protean 2 is a high priority for you.
		-It's cheap (6 XP) and turns you into a powerful combatant.
	-Auspex is probably the next thing to increase, helping your scout/spy role.
	-Fortitude is probably the most attractive discipline for you to get.
		-More important the more combat there is.
		-Also solid roleplaying. You're afraid of getting hurt and struggling to survive.
	-If there's lots of combat, Celerity and Potence are the melee staples.
	-You've a variety of abilities you might want to increase too.
	-Tentative schedule:
