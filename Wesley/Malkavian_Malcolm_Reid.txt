Backstory:

	Malcolm lusted after a somewhat well known but reclusive English Toreador painter named Cade Hall for many years. After getting two close he was embraced by another vampire in his orbit. After the embrace Malcom became even more infatuated. Cade rejected him as a as a creepy, talentless Malkavian bodhran player from the backwaters of Scotland. One night Malcolm killed Cade in a fit of rage, after which Malcolm disocciated and now thinks that he himself is Cade.

	Malcolm now forgets about his beloved bodhran and has transformed Cade's classical painting style into bleeding edge avant-guard music video performance peices combining vibrant colors (usually favoring a red hue), multiple subjects scantily clad in flesh tone leather, and etheral synth pads.

	A mysterious Toreador figure was enraged at Cade's death but is oddly still invested in his career. He has acknowledged Malcolm the artist Cade Hall but still cannot stand to see sight of Malcolm's face. This mysterious benefactor called a favor from a connection in Chicago, got Malcolm on a cargo ship, and made him an offer of a fresh start that he really can't refuse.

	As a Malkavian, Malcolm was a bit of a loner and found most of his food from night clubs. Cade Hall, on the other hand, entrances his artistic subjects and drinks, sometimes sloppily, in between takes.




	Presentation to the Prince on October, 8th, 1991. Malcolm has been in the city for a week or so.

		- Speech:

		To Kindred, blood is not merely sustenance; it is the very essence of life, a sacred and intoxicating elixir that transcends mere physical need. It is the lifeblood of their existence, a conduit to their immortality and power, and a deep, unyielding link to the living world they are forever separated from.

		Blood is glory itself. Each drop is a symphony of vitality, carrying with it the primal force of existence—a rhythm that pulses in the veins of every mortal being. To taste it is to taste life itself, raw and unfiltered. To drain it is to siphon the very soul of the living, to momentarily capture a fleeting spark of what it means to be truly alive. The act of feeding is not just a hunger, but a sacred ritual, a powerful assertion of the vampire’s dominance over death, a reclaiming of what time has taken away.

		Every vessel that holds blood is a treasure trove of memories, experiences, and emotions—sublime and ephemeral. The blood of a warrior is seasoned with pride and valor; the blood of an artist hums with creativity and passion. To a vampire, each unique flavor, each distinct pulse, is a brushstroke in the grand painting of existence. The more one feeds, the deeper their connection to the tapestry of life becomes, a kaleidoscope of sensations that floods the senses.

		Yet, blood is also a dangerous drug. For a vampire, the allure of blood is a siren’s call, a maddening obsession that beckons with the promise of power, but can drag them into madness or endless thirst. Its glory is matched only by its peril—its sweetness is addictive, its potential to corrupt infinite. The vampire who loses control may be lost to the frenzy, consumed by their own need.

		In their eternal night, where time stands still and the world changes without them, blood is the one constant—unchanging, immortal, glorious. It is both the key to their survival and the very thing that defines them. Blood is their strength and their curse, their power and their prison. To drink is to embrace their true nature: both predator and parasite, divine and damned.
