Backstory:

	Malcolm lusted after a somewhat well known but reclusive English Toreador painter named Cade Hall for many years. After getting two close he was embraced by another vampire in his orbit. After the embrace Malcom became even more infatuated. Cade rejected him as a as a creepy, talentless Malkavian bodhran player from the backwaters of Scotland. One night Malcolm killed Cade in a fit of rage, after which Malcolm disocciated and now thinks that he himself is Cade.

	Malcolm now forgets about his beloved bodhran and has transformed Cade's classical painting style into bleeding edge avant-guard music video performance peices combining vibrant colors (usually favoring a red hue), multiple subjects scantily clad in flesh tone leather, and etheral synth pads.

	A mysterious Toreador figure was enraged at Cade's death but is oddly still invested in his career. He has acknowledged Malcolm the artist Cade Hall but still cannot stand to see sight of Malcolm's face. This mysterious benefactor called a favor from a connection in Chicago, got Malcolm on a cargo ship, and made him an offer of a fresh start that he really can't refuse.

	As a Malkavian, Malcolm was a bit of a loner and found most of his food from night clubs. Cade Hall, on the other hand, entrances his artistic subjects and drinks, sometimes sloppily, in between takes.




	Presentation to the Prince on October, 8th, 1991. Malcolm has been in the city for a week or so.
