-Story beats, in order:
	-Build sympathy for the caitiff:
		-Caitiff rescue from Brujah thugs?
			-"Prince Lodin's childe's lover", "Didn't do it for you"/boon
			-Anarch vs. Camarilla a factor in this harrassment?
				-Oh! The Nihilist Anarch coterie is very into this kind of thing with young,
				 Camarilla-affiliated Kindred.
					-Coterie summary on pg. 160 of CBN.
					-Dickie is a solid candidate, who loathes the Camarilla, but is a Caitiff
					 himself.
						-Could easily change him to Brujah, though.
						-The wanted by Lodin aspect could be an issue, though.
					-Gengis is a decent candidate, and even the book is unclear on whether he's
					 Caitiff or Brujah.
					-Levesque is probably to suave for the purpose, but his hat for the Sheriff
					 easily could transfer to Cammies in general.
					-Damien is a bit better, but not by much.
					-The rest, Euclid and Neon, are more the kind of charity cases I want to
					 portray the Caitiff as.
		-Alternately, if unsympathetic, this story is going to be about learning to regret that,
		 and the danger that even the downtrodden can pose if united/empowered.
	-Presentation to the Prince:
		-Featuring scorn demonstrated for the caitiff, somewhere in the social occasion.
		-
	-Deal with Masquerade violation:
		-Tasked by the Prince at presentation.
			-Partial recompense for granting sires permission to embrace the players?
		-
	-Witness Caitiff abuse, by Son?
		-If brought to Prince Lodin's court, O'Leary and Paula Smith should rescue Son, maybe
		 with Ben Smith too, avoiding any consequence for Son.
		-In CbN 2nd Ed., Son has killed Neon, but fucking with Neon would provoke major rage
		 from  Damien. Some other target is probably better.
		-Maybe an invented Caitiff?
	-
-Set in Chicago:
	-Chicago By Night has the city the site of a lot of Camarilla vs. Anarch conflicts, though
	 I can easily set it in any minima or maxima in that conflict.
	 -Yeah, lets set it some time on, with Anarchs in an even worse spot.
	-Let coterie see "Son" preying on Caitiff, then protected by O'Leary and Lodin?
		-Yes! Given his openness to the Sabbat, our Evangelist could even be seen later to reign
		 him in a bit in a way that Camarilla elders were unable to, building some respect for 
		 the Evangelist in the players. . . before his secret is revealed.
	-Fate of the printed Sabbat coterie:
		-Their uprising was thwarted, with Wendy Wade destroyed in the process and Phillipe
		 captured.
			-Chicago Kindred would describe Wade, if at all, as the typically senselessly
			 violent Masquerade risk that they'd stereotype all Sabbat as.
			-Phillipe is staked, his capture known only to Lodin and a trusted lieutenant or
			 two.
				-He was already the same generation as Lodin, so maybe up that by one to explain
				 why Dominate hasn't gotten anything from him yet, and why he's kept around
				 until perhaps it could.
					-After all, a Sabbat of such high generation?!?
					-Perhaps Phillipe even got that extra bump from diablerie in Chicago?
			-Tyler's past was never revealed, but Phillipe did reach out to her, and she now
			 lives in fear it _was_ revealed (and would be very alarmed to learn Phillipe wasn't
			 destroyed).
			-Son's contact with them also went unknown to the rest of Chicago.
				-He's perhaps concerned that his involvement could hurt them, but not at all
				 turned off by their revealed affiliation.
	-Utility of existing Caitiff:
		-Gordon Keaton is a terrible fit for the sympathy I have in mind, but actually _great_ for
		 building some for Priscilla Gibbs / "Madame Zharinsky".
			-She is also a fantastic person for "togetherness ritual" stuff, since she's bound to
			 him.
		-Richard Fulcher ("Dickie") I'm redefining as a Brujah.
		-Carol Davis ("Maldavis") I'm deeply uncertain of the use of. . .
		-Derrick Stack ("Uriah") might be another great one to play with bond stuff, and to even
		 tie in Maldavis.
		-Jimmy Holcomb ("Neon") is _perfect_ for the stuff I have in mind, though his close ties to
		 Damien will need to be watched carefully.
-Invent more Caitiffs:
	-Ideally some pathetic ones. . .
	-My "more prey than predator" Caitiff is great for this.
	-
-Set one or more of coterie up for the bond?
	-Ignorantly falling into it is a common them in Chicago by Night.
-Set in 1991.
	-Initially figured the current year.
		-Good time for the old socialists and the like among the anarchs to hav been crushed. . .
	-On the other hand, setting well in the past, like the year Chicago by Night was written,
	 offers lots of room to stretch the game over without doing science fiction.
	-Yeah, talked with the players and they're good with starting in '91, the publication date
	 of the first Chicago by Night.
-Players:
	-Quiana Gannon (Rohit):
		-Clan Tremere.
		-TV journalist and gambler.
		-Family money.
		-Physical character sheet.
		-Sire is Abraham DuSable.
			-TODO: What race is the PC? DuSable probably has strong feeling about the subject. . .
		-Why did Prince Lodin grant permission for his embrace?
			-I don't think he knew exactly who the target was.
			-But open ended permission might even be a _bigger_ ask. . .
	-Malcolm Reid / Cade Hall (Wesley):
		-Clan Malkavian (Malcolm Reid), but is under the delusion he is a Toreador (Cade Hall).
			-A kind of multiple personality disorder.
		-Abstract painter and performance artist, throwing paint on models.
			-Feeds from his models too.
		-New to the city (from outside the country?).
			-In fact, that's the reason for his association with Rohit. Someone paid his way in
			 boons to get to the city, and get set up there. At least one such favor called in
			 came from Abraham DuSable, and he's pushing that responsibility of onto Rohit as
			 the cost of his continued patronage of his childe.
		-Wesley was open to the idea of there having once _been_ a Toreador: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1152273978954625064/1323148189460729919
			-Once a promising artist, and an object of envy for Cade, now dead by
			 Cade's hand with him assuming the identity, to one degree or another.
			-Danced around it with him, but I'm clearly imagining diablerie.
			-Could also explain why "someone powerful paid your way in favors to do so: a
			 promising young Toreador was gone too soon, but here's a Malkavian, admittedly
			 they're murderer, doing they're damndest (heh) to keep that legacy alive (and
			 there's some secrets that might lead an elder vampire to think there might be more
			 to it than just insanity)."
	-Give them each Camarilla Lore dot?
		-Maybe a clan Lore dot too, at least for Rohit?
-Prelude:
	-Quiana was asked by DuSable to help get Cade set up in Chicago, in return for some long ago
	 boon.
	 	-He was in town for ~1 week before his presentation.
		-Quiana met him at the marina next to Grant Park as he got off a small boat, having traveled
		 by sea from the UK (there was a transfer from a seagoing cargo ship).
		-She immediately took him clubbing, by his request, bringing him to a speakeasy-like basement
		 club called Library.
			-There, looking for someone "plump, veiny, and lonely, Cade met plump Melinda.
			-He lured her to the bathroom with promises of cocaine, fed from her (to some delight
			 on her part, and then claimed to have dropped his cocaine.
			-Nonetheless, he did get her number, and also received much glaring from her when, after
			 she returned to a booth full of friends, Cade went straight back to Quiana at the bar.
		-Afterwards, Quiana took him back to the Tremere Chantry, an old mansion in the Gold Coast
		 neighborhood, to spend his first day in Chicago.
		 	-Cade was briefly greet DuSable.
-First story:
	-Takes place October 8th, 1991.
	-On the way to presentation to Prince Lodin:
		-Confronted by the trio of Dickie (Brujah in my game, instead of Caitiff), Gengis
		 (Brujah), and Marc Levesque (Brujah; "Frenchie", but _hates_ it).
			-
			-Gengis: "Yeah! You tell him, Dick. . . head.
			 Dickie, sarcastically: ". . . Nice one, dumbshit."
		-Saved by Caitiff, Priscilla/"Madame".
			-Lover of the prince's childe?
				-Ah, maybe claims there's more to why Joseph Peterson is pissed about
				 Quiana than is widely known?
					-Yeah, this is perfect.
				-"Madame" is the perfect person to spred a salacious rumor like this.
	-Presentation to the prince:
		-Quiana is loathed by Prince Lodin and Joseph Peterson, due to Tremere maneuvering
		 around his Embrace.
		-Only other Tremere present will be Garwood Marshall.
			-This event is more about the general public than the Primogen so Nicolai feels no
			 need to be present, and he and DuSable would rather let Quiana suffer the
			 brunt of the Ventrues' displeasure over their scheme.
			-Garwood will be socializing with his bandmates, Sophia (Toreador stripper), and 
			 maybe Annabelle.
			-Quiana should recognize him.
		-Do the Malkavians show?
			-I don't think Cade's actual clan will be known. . . but Malkavians have ways
			 of knowing things. . .
			-Ah, make the date October 8th, the anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire and the
			 one day Prince Lodin forces O'Leary to attend to him, rather than avoiding him at
			 all costs?
		-Introduce Desmond Lee at the same time?
			-Cashing in some boon to settle (publicly!) in Chicago?
				-Boon held by "Brandon McCarthy"?
				-Delivers to Lodin the colonel's insignia Lodin brandished about in Vera Cruz?
			-
			-Drive him off with the smell of garlic, due to Horatio Ballard eating?
				-Limits initial familiarity with the stranger, while also showing off Ballard's
				 disgusting talent.
					-Oh! Have some mortal who shows a family resemblance. to Horatio and Lawrence
					 both, deliver it, to wedge in another detail?
		-Prince will certainly snub Quiana, and maybe Cade by association.
			-Use this as an opportunity to push them toward the Caitiff.
				-"Stand with the rabble. I have other business to attend to. . ."?
				-Or simply have those more elite follow the Prince's lead and turn away from them?
				-Priscilla/"Madame" will be there with them, and she's almost a friendly face
				 for them by this point, hopefully.
					-Gordon Keaton will be there too, and they should both see mistreatment of
					 her by them ("Whore") and her fawning over him.
		-Maureen O'Leary and her clanmates should be the first to rescue the PCs from their
		 snubbing.
			-Son wheels her over to them, to examine Cade.
				-Remember the Humanity roll in Son's description!
			-Who else is with them?
				-Eh, probably no one else. The Smith's rarely leave the asylum and the others
				 are not strongly associated with the inmates.
			-Cade should be subjected uncomfortable examination by O'Leary: lots of
			 staring and face touching.
				-Afterwards, she should seem satisfied, maybe with a knowing nod, but mostly
				 speak gibberish.
				-"Artist who changes people. . ."?
		-Annabelle Treabelle should then use that as giving her leave to approach Cade
		 too.
			-Excellent opportunity for her to snub Caitiff and display scorn for them.
			-She'll extend invitations to Cade.
				-Both over to her clique in Elysium and to a party later, at her mansion.
					-She should emphasize the word "mansion". . .
					-She's clearly sniffing around Cade to use him as a potential new
					 novelty to spice up her parties.
				-The party will draw heavily on the "Annabelle's Party Elite" coterie.
		-Pushed Joseph Peterson to address a Masquerade violation.
			-The Ventrue demand this of _Cade_, rather than Quiana.
				-Tied to the art world, it's a filmmaker creating problematic films.
				-His name is Arthur Webb.
				-Ultimately, he saw films by Johann Weltmann, which led Webb down this path.
					-Weltmann's films aren't really a danger to the Masquerade _themselves_, instead
					 brushing up against concepts and themes adjacent to _Golconda_.
					-That, though, led Webb to do further research, and start incorporating more
					 obviously problematic concepts in his own films.
					-But, that wouldn't necessarily mean a ruthless PC couldn't use the link to
					 make trouble for Weltmann.
					-On the other hand, a differently disposed PC could use this to pick up the
					 trail of Golconda. . .
					-Weltmann is just generally a fantastic NPC for Cade to interact with.
