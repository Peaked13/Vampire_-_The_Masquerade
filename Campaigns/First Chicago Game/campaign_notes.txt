-Story beats, in order:
	-Build sympathy for the caitiff:
		-Caitiff rescue from Brujah thugs?
			-"Prince Lodin's childe's lover", "Didn't do it for you"/boon
			-Anarch vs. Camarilla a factor in this harrassment?
				-Oh! The Nihilist Anarch coterie is very into this kind of thing with young,
				 Camarilla-affiliated Kindred.
					-Coterie summary on pg. 160 of CBN.
					-Dickie is a solid candidate, who loathes the Camarilla, but is a Caitiff
					 himself.
						-Could easily change him to Brujah, though.
						-The wanted by Lodin aspect could be an issue, though.
					-Gengis is a decent candidate, and even the book is unclear on whether he's
					 Caitiff or Brujah.
					-Levesque is probably to suave for the purpose, but his hat for the Sheriff
					 easily could transfer to Cammies in general.
					-Damien is a bit better, but not by much.
					-The rest, Euclid and Neon, are more the kind of charity cases I want to
					 portray the Caitiff as.
		-Alternately, if unsympathetic, this story is going to be about learning to regret that,
		 and the danger that even the downtrodden can pose if united/empowered.
	-Presentation to the Prince:
		-Featuring scorn demonstrated for the caitiff, somewhere in the social occasion.
		-
	-Deal with Masquerade violation:
		-Tasked by the Prince at presentation.
			-Partial recompense for granting sires permission to embrace the players?
		-
	-Witness Caitiff abuse, by Son?
		-If brought to Prince Lodin's court, O'Leary and Paula Smith should rescue Son, maybe
		 with Ben Smith too, avoiding any consequence for Son.
		-In CbN 2nd Ed., Son has killed Neon, but fucking with Neon would provoke major rage
		 from  Damien. Some other target is probably better.
		-Maybe an invented Caitiff?
	-
-Set in Chicago:
	-Chicago By Night has the city the site of a lot of Camarilla vs. Anarch conflicts, though
	 I can easily set it in any minima or maxima in that conflict.
	 -Yeah, lets set it some time on, with Anarchs in an even worse spot.
	-Let coterie see "Son" preying on Caitiff, then protected by O'Leary and Lodin?
		-Yes! Given his openness to the Sabbat, our Evangelist could even be seen later to reign
		 him in a bit in a way that Camarilla elders were unable to, building some respect for 
		 the Evangelist in the players. . . before his secret is revealed.
	-Fate of the printed Sabbat coterie:
		-Their uprising was thwarted, with Wendy Wade destroyed in the process and Phillipe
		 captured.
			-Chicago Kindred would describe Wade, if at all, as the typically senselessly
			 violent Masquerade risk that they'd stereotype all Sabbat as.
			-Phillipe is staked, his capture known only to Lodin and a trusted lieutenant or
			 two.
				-He was already the same generation as Lodin, so maybe up that by one to explain
				 why Dominate hasn't gotten anything from him yet, and why he's kept around
				 until perhaps it could.
					-After all, a Sabbat of such high generation?!?
					-Perhaps Phillipe even got that extra bump from diablerie in Chicago?
			-Tyler's past was never revealed, but Phillipe did reach out to her, and she now
			 lives in fear it _was_ revealed (and would be very alarmed to learn Phillipe wasn't
			 destroyed).
			-Son's contact with them also went unknown to the rest of Chicago.
				-He's perhaps concerned that his involvement could hurt them, but not at all
				 turned off by their revealed affiliation.
	-Utility of existing Caitiff:
		-Gordon Keaton is a terrible fit for the sympathy I have in mind, but actually _great_ for
		 building some for Priscilla Gibbs / "Madame Zharinsky".
			-She is also a fantastic person for "togetherness ritual" stuff, since she's bound to
			 him.
		-Richard Fulcher ("Dickie") I'm redefining as a Brujah.
		-Carol Davis ("Maldavis") I'm deeply uncertain of the use of. . .
		-Derrick Stack ("Uriah") might be another great one to play with bond stuff, and to even
		 tie in Maldavis.
		-Jimmy Holcomb ("Neon") is _perfect_ for the stuff I have in mind, though his close ties to
		 Damien will need to be watched carefully.
-Invent more Caitiffs:
	-Ideally some pathetic ones. . .
	-Fred Pearson:
		-My "more prey than predator" Caitiff. He's great for this.
	-Cally Reynolds:
		-Thinblooded family woman.
	-Matt Fisher:
		-Burnout sired by a passing Ravnos.
-Set one or more of coterie up for the bond?
	-Ignorantly falling into it is a common them in Chicago by Night.
-Set in 1991.
	-Initially figured the current year.
		-Good time for the old socialists and the like among the anarchs to hav been crushed. . .
	-On the other hand, setting well in the past, like the year Chicago by Night was written,
	 offers lots of room to stretch the game over without doing science fiction.
	-Yeah, talked with the players and they're good with starting in '91, the publication date
	 of the first Chicago by Night.
-Players:
	-Quiana Gannon (Rohit):
		-Clan Tremere.
		-TV journalist and gambler.
		-Family money.
		-Physical character sheet.
		-Sire is Abraham DuSable.
			-Quiana is black. DuSable has strong feeling about the subject. . .
		-Why did Prince Lodin grant permission for his embrace?
			-I don't think he knew exactly who the target was.
			-But open ended permission might even be a _bigger_ ask. . .
		-She has a room at the Tremere chantry, but also a highrise apartment nearby.
	-Malcolm Reid / Cade Hall (Wesley):
		-Clan Malkavian (Malcolm Reid), but is under the delusion he is a Toreador (Cade Hall).
			-A kind of multiple personality disorder.
		-Abstract painter and performance artist, throwing paint on models.
			-Feeds from his models too.
		-New to the city (from outside the country?).
			-In fact, that's the reason for his association with Rohit. Someone paid his way in
			 boons to get to the city, and get set up there. At least one such favor called in
			 came from Abraham DuSable, and he's pushing that responsibility of onto Rohit as
			 the cost of his continued patronage of his childe.
		-There once _was_ a Toreador: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1152273978954625064/1323148189460729919
			-Once a promising artist, and an object of envy for Cade, now dead by
			 Cade's hand with him assuming the identity, to one degree or another.
			-Danced around it with him, but I'm clearly imagining diablerie.
			-Could also explain why "someone powerful paid your way in favors to do so: a
			 promising young Toreador was gone too soon, but here's a Malkavian, admittedly
			 they're murderer, doing they're damndest (heh) to keep that legacy alive (and
			 there's some secrets that might lead an elder vampire to think there might be more
			 to it than just insanity)."
		-Herd is a crowd of artsy party goers he plies with drugs and promises of fame through his
		 performance art.
			-Melinda, who he met (and fed on) on his first night in Chicago was the seed of that.
		-Haven is currently a rented artist's loft, with a dark room possessed of a steel door and
		 locks that he sleeps in.
		-Owing to a Camarilla Lore botch concerning ghouls, he's convinced that he _shouldn't_ let
		 humans drink is blood, and that they're always fiending for his precious bodily fluids.
	-Give them each Camarilla Lore dot?
		-Yeah, gave them each the Camarilla dot.
		-Maybe a clan Lore dot too, at least for Rohit?
-Prelude:
	-Quiana was asked by DuSable to help get Cade set up in Chicago, in return for some long ago
	 boon.
	 	-He was in town for ~1 week before his presentation.
		-Quiana met him at the marina next to Grant Park as he got off a small boat, having traveled
		 by sea from the UK (there was a transfer from a seagoing cargo ship).
		-She immediately took him clubbing, by his request, bringing him to a speakeasy-like basement
		 club called Library.
			-There, looking for someone "plump, veiny, and lonely", Cade met plump Melinda.
			-He lured her to the bathroom with promises of cocaine, fed from her (to some delight
			 on her part, and then claimed to have dropped his cocaine.
			-Nonetheless, he did get her number, and also received much glaring from her when, after
			 she returned to a booth full of friends, Cade went straight back to Quiana at the bar.
		-Afterwards, Quiana took him back to the Tremere Chantry, an old mansion in the Gold Coast
		 neighborhood, to spend his first day in Chicago.
		 	-Cade was briefly greet DuSable.
	-Since Cade's experience with Melinda left him thinking that procuring some actual drugs might
	 make feeding easier, there might be an opportunity there to get him involved with, depending
	 on the direction he goes, Kevin Jackson or Capone.
		-Have him be recognized for what he is, given the drugs for no money, but told he know owes
		 on or the other?
		-Yep! Cade reached out to Quiana about procuring some ketamine and benzos and she, in turn,
		 called her contact, "Carty" about the subject.
			-She'd gotten cocaine from him in the past, but the downers weren't his thing. He was,
			 however, able to call someone in turn and then called her back with an address "just
			 South of Old Town".
				-She (and Rohit himself) recognized this as near Cabrini Green, and the danger.
			-Both Cade and Quiana went.
			-Everyone at the place was wearing red.
			-Knocking on the door and asking for "Eddy", they were let in and directed down a beat
			 up hallway.
			-Quiana Dominated the guy who answered the door, having him fetch her the drugs, rather
			 that go further into the rowhouse.
			-That resulted in an audible beating for the Dominated gang member, due to the breach
			 of protocol, and a gold chain bedecked man storming down the hallway towards them,
			 hand on the grip of a pistol at his waist.
			-Before things got too out of hand, though, the guy paused, stared at them a moment, and
			 then said, ". . . I know what you are. C'mere. . ."
			-He led them down the hallway to a worn livingroom and, confirming what they wanted,
			 handed them a half pound of ketamine, a grab bad of ~100 assorted pills, and some crack.
			-Instead of asking for payment, though, he said, "You know Kevin? . . . You owe Kevin
			 Jackson."
				-". . . Where do we find Kevin?" Quiana asked.
				 "He'll find you. Don't worry about it. You'll see him around one of your lots'
				 things."
			-Boons:
				-Cade now owes a minor boon to Quiana for this.
				-Both players owe a minor boon to Kevin Jackson, or maybe a bit more, for the drugs
				 and for having fucked around in his domain (particularly Dominating that guy).
-Gave XP for the prelude.
	-Core pg. 131 (PDF numbering) is useful.
	-I don't especially like giving differing amounts to different people (_maybe_ for out-of-session
	 work), but 2 pts. to both does feel reasonaby justified after the prelude.
	-Opted for 3.
-First story:
	-Took place October 8th, 1991.
	-Quiana drove, picking up Cade at his studio, along with an enormous painted triptych he made
	 for the occasion.
		-Wesley found a real painting made with blood and semen that he's modeling it after.
			-Has Cade made something like this before? Has it yellowed? Could be mistaken as
			 fitting the fire theme of the event. . .
				-No, he hasn't, so it has indeed yellowed!
		-They parked the car in a garage, roughly a block and a half from the museum.
	-On the way to presentation to Prince Lodin:
		-Confronted by the trio of Dickie (Brujah in my game, instead of Caitiff), Gengis
		 (Brujah), and Marc Levesque (Brujah; "Frenchie", but _hates_ it).
			-Threatening the "baby Cammies":
				""
				"Don't think telling any tales will help you. Your Cammie 'friends' will pounce on
				 any weakness you show."
			-Gengis: "Yeah! You tell him, Dick. . . head.
			 Dickie, sarcastically: ". . . Nice one, dumbshit."
		-Saved by Caitiff, Priscilla/"Madame".
			-Lover of the prince's childe?
				-Ah, maybe claims there's more to why Joseph Peterson is pissed about
				 Quiana than is widely known?
					-Yeah, this is perfect.
				-"Madame" is the perfect person to spred a salacious rumor like this.
			-They heard her referred to as "Pris".
			-Cade said something about "horror" in a thick Scottish accent, leading her to angrily
			 ask, "What did you call me?!?", but they didn't really interrogate the matter and
			 figure out how they'd given offense, instead quickly moving on.
		-They heard the names "Marc" and Gengis and Marc's "French" accent.
		-They saw Dickie Obfuscated as a black man, though did hear the "Dick. . . head" bit.
	-Presentation to the prince:
		-Hosted at the Art Institute, in a large gallery filled, for the occasion, with paintings
		 of flames and, especially, burning cities.
		-Upon entering the room, have the PCs roll Perception + Empathy _and_ Perception +
		 Ettiquette to get information about the people present.
		-Quiana is loathed by Prince Lodin and Joseph Peterson, due to Tremere maneuvering
		 around her Embrace.
		-Only other Tremere present will be Garwood Marshall.
			-This event is more about the general public than the Primogen so Nicolai feels no
			 need to be present, and he and DuSable would rather let Quiana suffer the
			 brunt of the Ventrues' displeasure over their scheme.
			-Garwood will be socializing with his bandmates, Sophia (Toreador stripper), and 
			 maybe Annabelle.
				-Damien might hit on Quiana.
			-Quiana should recognize him.
				-In fact, she went up and talked to him even before introducing herself to Prince
				 Lodin, which he had to sort of push her to go do.
				-Damien did indeed hit on her, and was the only other member of Baby Chorus she
				 managed to exchange introductions with before her presentation.
		-Ventrue present:
			-Lodin, of course.
				-His Status is obvious from both how his broods are arranged around him and by the
				 near-throne on which he sits.
					-A Knowledge or other roll related to the arts (or maybe Chicago) would identify
					 this and much of the rest of the furnishings as objects from the Institute's
					 collections.
					-An _especially_ good roll would identify other bits as _not_ from the
					 collection, or anywhere else you know, but being of _at least_ as lavish
					 quality.
			-Capone:
				-No roll necessary here: there are at least 5 spots within a block where you could
				 buy a t-shirt with his face on it, and he has taken to playing up the gangster
				 aesthetic even more than he did in life.
			-Joseph Peterson:
				-Quiana should recognize him, having interacted with him at least briefly before
				 her embrace.
			-Kevin Jackson:
				-Red suit, surrounded by black kine showing the same gang colors.
			-Horatio and Lawrence Ballard:
				-Perception + Alertness to notice a family resemblence.
				-Perception + Empathy to notice the power relationship.
				-Either way, Horatio's corpulence certainly stands out.
			-Alan Sovereign waiting on Horatio.
			-Edward Neally waiting on Lodin.
			-Schumpter and Thornhill are circulating, while Bobby Weatherbottom stands alone in one
			 corner.
		-Rolls:
			-Quiana and Cade each got 3 or 4 successes on their Perception + Alertness and Perception
			 + Empathy rolls (one each on each, and with opposite results, Alertness vs. Empathy, but
			 I don't remember who was which). Close enough that they both get similar info in both
			 categories.
		-Maureen O'Leary attends, wheeled in by Son and escorted by Ventrue goons.
			-I don't think Cade's actual clan will be known. . . but Malkavians have ways
			 of knowing things. . .
			-Ah, made the date October 8th, the anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire and the
			 one day Prince Lodin forces O'Leary to attend to him, rather than avoiding him at
			 all costs.
			-After being wheeled in shortly after the PCs, her eyes kept coming back to Cade, when
			 they weren't jerking around to many different points of the room looking for threats.
			-Son was rather offputting to Cade (one success on the humanity roll) and Quiana
			 recognized him for the stone-cold psychopath he is (six successes!).
		-Prince will certainly snub Quiana, and maybe Cade by association.
			-They actually ended up presenting separately, Quiana delaying the event as much as
			 possible, but Cade walking up very shortly after entering, almost as fast as he could
			 drag his enormous triptych (that Quiana had stopped helping carry to talk with Garwood)
			 over.
				-It actually went rather well, with the Prince remarking that Queen Anne (Prince of
				 London) was a dear friend of his (after hearing Cade had arrived from there) and
				 mostly appreciating Cade's artwork.
					-He commented that it was a bit abstract for his taste, but the yellowing had
					 served Cade well and he said he appreciated the "flame" motif on the occasion.
					-He directed one of his besuited goons to find a place to hang it in the gallery
					 for the event.
			-Lodin indeed snubbed Quiana, giving quite the cold reception despite her fawning display
			 of humility.
				-She then attempted (hard) to converse with Joseph Peterson, ignoring him turning
				 his back to her and trying to insist, only for him to shout angrily at her to "Get
				 the fuck away from me!"
					-I wonder if she believed Priscilla at face value. . .
				-It was then that the Prince intervened again, telling her to leave Mr. Peterson
				 alone and go stand with the other rabble, pointing at the Caitiff.
			-Used this as an opportunity to push Quiana toward the Caitiff.
				-"Stand with the rabble, and leave Mr. Peterson be. . ."
				-Priscilla/"Madame" will be there with them, and she's almost a friendly face
				 for them by this point, hopefully.
					-Gordon Keaton will be there too, and they should both see mistreatment of
					 her by them ("Whore") and her fawning over him.
		-Introduced Desmond Lee at the same time:
			-Coming from Corpus Christi, "fleeing" the Sabbat.
			-Cashing in some boon to settle (publicly!) in Chicago.
				-Boon held by "Brandon McCarthy".
				-Delivered to Lodin the colonel's insignia Lodin brandished about in Vera Cruz.
			-Recognized by Wolf Pack member.
				-Tyrus, their leader, said he remembered meeting McCarthy there when last they rode
				 through, and thought he saw Des there too.
				-They visited _due_ to it's impending danger from The Sabbat.
			-Drove him off with the smell of garlic, due to Horatio Ballard eating.
				-Limits initial familiarity with the stranger, while also showing off Ballard's
				 disgusting talent.
					-Had some mortal who shows a family resemblance, to Horatio and Lawrence both,
					 deliver it, to wedge in another detail.
				-Mentioned, mostly to Rohit, the smell of the food, wedging garlic in among the
				 various Italian food spices, and also mentioned garlic bread, but he didn't seem
				 to pick up on the carefully disguised significance.
		-Cade approached Kevin Jackson.
			-He introduced himself (though Jackson seemed to know who he was) and rather graciously
			 thanked Jackson for his help.
			-He mentioned an interest in moving "product" of his own, but, once he made it clear
			 he was referring to his _art_, Jackson pointed Cade at his "fellow Toreador".
		-So Cade then approached Annabelle Treabelle and her clique.
			-She was carefully escorted by Bret.
			-She took the opportunity to display scorn for the Caitiff.
			-She extended an invitation to Cade to a party later, at her mansion.
				-She emphasized the word "mansion". . .
				-She's clearly sniffing around Cade to use him as a potential new
				 novelty to spice up her parties.
				-She gave the date as 10/12, two hours after sundown, and had Brett give Cade her
				 "calling card".
				-She also told him to bring a guest.
			-Complemented the triptych and it's right-on-theme nature (apparently).
				-"The flames and. . . *sniff* commemorating the. . . seminal moment of the
				  Prince's reign. . . It's. . . *chef's kiss*"
			-"This city needed some new excitement. Why, I was bored enough attend Drummond's
			  _railroad_ exhibition last month. . ."
				-It was an opportunity to plant a seed that could be used if I run the "Anabelle's
				 Party" story from Succubus Club.
			-Her clique there:
				-Bret
				-Sophia
				-Michael
		-Maureen O'Leary examined Cade and babbled at him.
			-Son wheeled her over to her, standing with Michael Payne (who beat a hasty retreat
			 while she was focused on Cade and holding his head in place.)
			-Who else is with them?
				-Eh, probably no one else. The Smiths rarely leave the asylum and the others
				 are not strongly associated with the inmates.
			-Cade should be subjected uncomfortable examination by O'Leary: lots of
			 staring and face touching.
				-Afterwards, she should seem satisfied, maybe with a knowing nod, but mostly
				 speak gibberish.
				-Phrases used:
					"Artist who changes people. . . who changed. . ."
					"What is that infernal racket?!?"
					"Pale of skin. . . dark of vein. Kin and kindred. . ."
				-Cade successfully made a(n easy) Willpower roll after his clanmate hinted she
				 recognized the relation.
		-Quiana got to spend a lot of time talking with the Caitiff.
			-She met:
				Gordon
				Priscilla
					-Quiana called her Pris, but was corrected: "Pri_scilla_, but you can call me
					 Madam."
					-Rohit got a strong sense of Pris's bond, even asking what sort of spell she was
					 under.
						-I played it up pretty hard, with her fawning over Gordon despite abuse
						 hurled her way, but playing it a mix of mean and cool towards everyone else.
				Cally
					-Described with "housewife dressed up for night out", "JC Penny dress".
				Matt
					-Described with long, greasy hair and a beat-up leather jacket.
				Fred
					-He didn't say a word to her, and quickly fled when Jackson's men eventually
					 approached. She and Des only got his name from Matt.
				Eventually, Des
			-Des was long on "us", "clanless" (not Caitiff), and pride.
				-Gordon left shortly after he arrived, in part due to the implied familiarity, and
				 implying he's as low as the rest of the Caitiff.
					-He went to go talk to Garwood.
				-Matt eventually corrected his assumption that Quiana was a Caitiff.
				-Des displayed some alarm at that, but was interrupted by the smell of Ballard's
				 dinner.
				-I certainly played up his disgust, and carefully had it begin when the _smell_
				 began, before Ballard began eating, but also threw in a lot of chaff concerning
				 how the various Kindred present found Ballard's eating disgusting too.
				-As he left, he choked out a invitation to all there (though he probably didn't
				 mean to extend it to Quiana) to meet him at The Succubus Club sometime.
			-Quiana then asked the Caitiff a variety of questions.
				-Why the Caitiff were held in such low esteem.
				-Who various people were, and what Clans they represented, including:
					-Baby Chorus
						-Only learned Damien's clan.
					-The Wolf Pack
					-Jackson and his men.
		-Kevin Jackson, noticing the attention from Quiana and the Caitiff, sent two of his men
		 over to collect Quiana.
			-She did make a somewhat sly attempt to pin the debt on Cade, but he responded that he
			 had it "on a good authority that _she_ made the call."
				-She mentioned she gave the drugs to Cade which met with, "Well, I hope he knows
				 how much he owes you, then, but that doesn't change what _you_ owe."
			-He mentioned an interest in Tremere shit: "A lot you can do with a witch. . ."
			-He also generally suggested (in a suggestive fashion) that she find ways to be useful.
			-She did offer a bit of her journalist role, though he didn't really bite.
		-Cade was asked by Joseph Peterson to address a Masquerade violation.
			-Tied to the art world, it's a filmmaker creating problematic films.
			-"He's very much your sort of _degenerate_ art. . ." with a glance at the triptych.
				-There was another easily passed Willpower role.
			-The filmmaker's name is Arthur Webb.
			-"Here's your opportunity to associate with a better class of Kindred. . . and do a
			  favor for one."
				-JP also sort of name dropped Lodin, implying some gratitude there too.
			-Cade expressed not-quite-feigned interest in what Peterson was selling, and agreed to
			 the plan.
			-Peterson gave him a business card, asking him to call and let him know when the matter
			 had been dealt with.
		-They both then spent some time talking with Baby Chorus.
			-Cade went over first, followed a little while later by Quiana.
			-Mentioned Succubus Club.
			-Told Cade about a gig at Blue Velvet on Friday.
			-Keaton was still there.
				-When Cade walked up, he heard Keaton and Garwood discussing a deal for blood, and
				 sending "two girls" over to the chantry.
				-Once Quiana arrived, Keaton said something about maybe seeing her around the chantry,
				 then left.
					-That prompted some questions for Garwood, who said, "Keaton is a resourceful
					 man. Resources The Pyramid can use. And you know well that Clan Tremere has a
					 lot to offer.
			-Both met all of the band, and got some sense of what's going on with Ray.
				-Space-cadet-y most of the time, but they saw flickers of other behavior, and Ray
				 even introduced himself to Quiana as Cliff, with a firm handshake.
				-Questions were mostly met with "Leave Ray alone. . ." and, once, "Also, stay away
				 from Cliff."
		-THE SESSION LEFT OFF HERE.
		-Edward Neally would be a good option if Quiana continues to attempt to harrass the prince.
			-His inherent morality is good enough reason to intervene, though it's also the actions
			 of the good servant he is.
			-It's a good opportunity to put that decency on display, for later use. . .
		-One of the Ballards might also approach Quiana, if I need more of that?
			-_Especially_ after Jackson is seen to do so, Horatio being a major rival of Capone, and
			 seeing opportunity in Capone and Jackson's incipent rivalry.
		-Khalid or another Nosferatu gently interrogating Quiana would also be an option.
			-Especially useful if she's floundering a bit, given all the cold shoulders and her (at
			 time of writing) separation from the more approachable Cade.
			-Khalid certainly is curious about why she was made, given that it has signs of a shift
			 in power and allegiances amongst he Prince and Primogen.
			-Hmm. . . Khalid rarely reveals himself to non-Nosferatu Kindred, but none of the other
			 Nosferatu are really suitable for this.
				-I was figuring he'd appear Masked, but I guess he will do so only if unobserved and
				 not reveal much of himself.
		-Followed home by bloods?
			-Perception + Alertness to detect.
			-Where does Quiana head back to?
				-If she _eventually_ goes back to the condo, well, they can wait patiently if need
				 be, though that may open more opportunities to learn about the tail, before or
				 after making it home.
			-If so, _both_ of them will eventually have a package waiting for them one evening.
				-Inside are three bricks, labeled K, C, and H, along with a paper heart, in blood
				 red, labeled KJ.
-Second story:
	-Baby Chorus gig at Blue Velvet on Friday, 10/11/91:
		-End up at Succubus club after?
			-Damien would go, and probably some of the others. Got the impression in one book or
			 another that Kathy has an issue with it, but maybe that's just _playing_ there.
			-Good opportunity to run into Des and some of the caitiff (Matt is easiest candidate).
		-
	-Anabelle's party at her mansion on Saturday 10/12/91:
		-She's clearly sniffing around Cade to use him as a potential new novelty to spice up her
		 parties.
		-Maybe even have the musician or sculptor mentioned on page 40 of Succubus Club at
		 Anabelle's first party?
			-
		-How can I work Desmond, or other Caitiff, into either party?
			-
		-The party will draw heavily on the "Annabelle's Party Elite" coterie.
		-
	-Arthur Webb's films, a Masquerade violation:
		-Ultimately, he saw films by Johann Weltmann, which led Webb down this path.
			-Weltmann's films aren't really a danger to the Masquerade _themselves_, instead
			 brushing up against concepts and themes adjacent to _Golconda_.
			-That, though, led Webb to do further research, and start incorporating more
			 obviously problematic concepts in his own films.
				- "resisting dark, bestial urges ; I mean ; vampires were a natural fit!"
			-But, that wouldn't necessarily mean a ruthless PC couldn't use the link to
			 make trouble for Weltmann.
			-On the other hand, a differently disposed PC could use this to pick up the
			 trail of Golconda. . .
			-Weltmann is just generally a fantastic NPC for Cade to interact with.
		-What Webb knows about Weltman:
			- more recent films are the ones that included this theme of "enlightenment"
				- his films aren't obviously dated, but content and production techniques enable strong guesses
			- unsure if he's still alive, but his age if so. . .
		-Hmm. . . occult symbolism and the like might be a way to push Cade to draw Quiana
		 into this. . .
