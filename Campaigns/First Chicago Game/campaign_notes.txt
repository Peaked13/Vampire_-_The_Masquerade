-Story beats, in order:
	-Build sympathy for the caitiff:
		-Caitiff rescue from Brujah thugs?
			-"Prince Lodin's childe's lover", "Didn't do it for you"/boon
			-Anarch vs. Camarilla a factor in this harrassment?
				-Oh! The Nihilist Anarch coterie is very into this kind of thing with young,
				 Camarilla-affiliated Kindred.
					-Coterie summary on pg. 160 of CBN.
					-Dickie is a solid candidate, who loathes the Camarilla, but is a Caitiff
					 himself.
						-Could easily change him to Brujah, though.
						-The wanted by Lodin aspect could be an issue, though.
					-Gengis is a decent candidate, and even the book is unclear on whether he's
					 Caitiff or Brujah.
					-Levesque is probably to suave for the purpose, but his hat for the Sheriff
					 easily could transfer to Cammies in general.
					-Damien is a bit better, but not by much.
					-The rest, Euclid and Neon, are more the kind of charity cases I want to
					 portray the Caitiff as.
		-Alternately, if unsympathetic, this story is going to be about learning to regret that,
		 and the danger that even the downtrodden can pose if united/empowered.
	-Presentation to the Prince:
		-Featuring scorn demonstrated for the caitiff, somewhere in the social occasion.
		-
	-Deal with Masquerade violation:
		-Tasked by the Prince at presentation.
			-Partial recompense for granting sires permission to embrace the players?
		-
	-Witness Caitiff abuse, by Son?
		-If brought to Prince Lodin's court, O'Leary and Paula Smith should rescue Son, maybe
		 with Ben Smith too, avoiding any consequence for Son.
		-In CbN 2nd Ed., Son has killed Neon, but fucking with Neon would provoke major rage
		 from  Damien. Some other target is probably better.
		-Maybe an invented Caitiff?
	-
-Set in Chicago:
	-Chicago By Night has the city the site of a lot of Camarilla vs. Anarch conflicts, though
	 I can easily set it in any minima or maxima in that conflict.
	 -Yeah, lets set it some time on, with Anarchs in an even worse spot.
	-Let coterie see "Son" preying on Caitiff, then protected by O'Leary and Lodin?
		-Yes! Given his openness to the Sabbat, our Evangelist could even be seen later to reign
		 him in a bit in a way that Camarilla elders were unable to, building some respect for 
		 the Evangelist in the players. . . before his secret is revealed.
	-Fate of the printed Sabbat coterie:
		-Their uprising was thwarted, with Wendy Wade destroyed in the process and Phillipe
		 captured.
			-Chicago Kindred would describe Wade, if at all, as the typically senselessly
			 violent Masquerade risk that they'd stereotype all Sabbat as.
			-Phillipe is staked, his capture known only to Lodin and a trusted lieutenant or
			 two.
				-He was already the same generation as Lodin, so maybe up that by one to explain
				 why Dominate hasn't gotten anything from him yet, and why he's kept around
				 until perhaps it could.
					-After all, a Sabbat of such high generation?!?
					-Perhaps Phillipe even got that extra bump from diablerie in Chicago?
			-Tyler's past was never revealed, but Phillipe did reach out to her, and she now
			 lives in fear it _was_ revealed (and would be very alarmed to learn Phillipe wasn't
			 destroyed).
			-Son's contact with them also went unknown to the rest of Chicago.
				-He's perhaps concerned that his involvement could hurt them, but not at all
				 turned off by their revealed affiliation.
	-Utility of existing Caitiff:
		-Gordon Keaton is a terrible fit for the sympathy I have in mind, but actually _great_ for
		 building some for Priscilla Gibbs / "Madame Zharinsky".
			-She is also a fantastic person for "togetherness ritual" stuff, since she's bound to
			 him.
		-Richard Fulcher ("Dickie") I'm redefining as a Brujah.
		-Carol Davis ("Maldavis") I'm deeply uncertain of the use of. . .
		-Derrick Stack ("Uriah") might be another great one to play with bond stuff, and to even
		 tie in Maldavis.
		-Jimmy Holcomb ("Neon") is _perfect_ for the stuff I have in mind, though his close ties to
		 Damien will need to be watched carefully.
-Invent more Caitiffs:
	-Ideally some pathetic ones. . .
	-Fred Pearson:
		-My "more prey than predator" Caitiff. He's great for this.
	-Cally Reynolds:
		-Thinblooded family woman.
	-Matt Fisher:
		-Burnout sired by a passing Ravnos.
-Set one or more of coterie up for the bond?
	-Ignorantly falling into it is a common them in Chicago by Night.
-Set in 1991.
	-Initially figured the current year.
		-Good time for the old socialists and the like among the anarchs to hav been crushed. . .
	-On the other hand, setting well in the past, like the year Chicago by Night was written,
	 offers lots of room to stretch the game over without doing science fiction.
	-Yeah, talked with the players and they're good with starting in '91, the publication date
	 of the first Chicago by Night.
-Players:
	-Quiana Gannon (Rohit):
		-Clan Tremere.
		-TV journalist and gambler.
		-Family money.
		-Physical character sheet.
		-Sire is Abraham DuSable.
			-Quiana is black. DuSable has strong feeling about the subject. . .
		-Why did Prince Lodin grant permission for his embrace?
			-I don't think he knew exactly who the target was.
			-But open ended permission might even be a _bigger_ ask. . .
		-She has a room at the Tremere chantry, but also a highrise apartment nearby.
	-Malcolm Reid / Cade Hall (Wesley):
		-Clan Malkavian (Malcolm Reid), but is under the delusion he is a Toreador (Cade Hall).
			-A kind of multiple personality disorder.
		-Abstract painter and performance artist, throwing paint on models.
			-Feeds from his models too.
		-New to the city (from outside the country?).
			-In fact, that's the reason for his association with Rohit. Someone paid his way in
			 boons to get to the city, and get set up there. At least one such favor called in
			 came from Abraham DuSable, and he's pushing that responsibility of onto Rohit as
			 the cost of his continued patronage of his childe.
		-There once _was_ a Toreador: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1152273978954625064/1323148189460729919
			-Once a promising artist, and an object of envy for Cade, now dead by
			 Cade's hand with him assuming the identity, to one degree or another.
			-Danced around it with him, but I'm clearly imagining diablerie.
			-Could also explain why "someone powerful paid your way in favors to do so: a
			 promising young Toreador was gone too soon, but here's a Malkavian, admittedly
			 they're murderer, doing they're damndest (heh) to keep that legacy alive (and
			 there's some secrets that might lead an elder vampire to think there might be more
			 to it than just insanity)."
		-Herd is a crowd of artsy party goers he plies with drugs and promises of fame through his
		 performance art.
			-Melinda, who he met (and fed on) on his first night in Chicago was the seed of that.
		-Haven is currently a rented artist's loft, with a dark room possessed of a steel door and
		 locks that he sleeps in.
		-Owing to a Camarilla Lore botch concerning ghouls, he's convinced that he _shouldn't_ let
		 humans drink is blood, and that they're always fiending for his precious bodily fluids.
	-Give them each Camarilla Lore dot?
		-Yeah, gave them each the Camarilla dot.
		-Maybe a clan Lore dot too, at least for Rohit?
-Prelude:
	-Quiana was asked by DuSable to help get Cade set up in Chicago, in return for some long ago
	 boon.
	 	-He was in town for ~1 week before his presentation.
		-Quiana met him at the marina next to Grant Park as he got off a small boat, having traveled
		 by sea from the UK (there was a transfer from a seagoing cargo ship).
		-She immediately took him clubbing, by his request, bringing him to a speakeasy-like basement
		 club called Library.
			-There, looking for someone "plump, veiny, and lonely", Cade met plump Melinda.
			-He lured her to the bathroom with promises of cocaine, fed from her (to some delight
			 on her part, and then claimed to have dropped his cocaine.
			-Nonetheless, he did get her number, and also received much glaring from her when, after
			 she returned to a booth full of friends, Cade went straight back to Quiana at the bar.
		-Afterwards, Quiana took him back to the Tremere Chantry, an old mansion in the Gold Coast
		 neighborhood, to spend his first day in Chicago.
		 	-Cade was briefly greet DuSable.
	-Since Cade's experience with Melinda left him thinking that procuring some actual drugs might
	 make feeding easier, there might be an opportunity there to get him involved with, depending
	 on the direction he goes, Kevin Jackson or Capone.
		-Have him be recognized for what he is, given the drugs for no money, but told he know owes
		 on or the other?
		-Yep! Cade reached out to Quiana about procuring some ketamine and benzos and she, in turn,
		 called her contact, "Carty" about the subject.
			-She'd gotten cocaine from him in the past, but the downers weren't his thing. He was,
			 however, able to call someone in turn and then called her back with an address "just
			 South of Old Town".
				-She (and Rohit himself) recognized this as near Cabrini Green, and the danger.
			-Both Cade and Quiana went.
			-Everyone at the place was wearing red.
			-Knocking on the door and asking for "Eddy", they were let in and directed down a beat
			 up hallway.
			-Quiana Dominated the guy who answered the door, having him fetch her the drugs, rather
			 that go further into the rowhouse.
			-That resulted in an audible beating for the Dominated gang member, due to the breach
			 of protocol, and a gold chain bedecked man storming down the hallway towards them,
			 hand on the grip of a pistol at his waist.
			-Before things got too out of hand, though, the guy paused, stared at them a moment, and
			 then said, ". . . I know what you are. C'mere. . ."
			-He led them down the hallway to a worn livingroom and, confirming what they wanted,
			 handed them a half pound of ketamine, a grab bad of ~100 assorted pills, and some crack.
			-Instead of asking for payment, though, he said, "You know Kevin? . . . You owe Kevin
			 Jackson."
				-". . . Where do we find Kevin?" Quiana asked.
				 "He'll find you. Don't worry about it. You'll see him around one of your lots'
				 things."
			-Boons:
				-Cade now owes a minor boon to Quiana for this.
				-Both players owe a minor boon to Kevin Jackson, or maybe a bit more, for the drugs
				 and for having fucked around in his domain (particularly Dominating that guy).
-Gave XP for the prelude.
	-Core pg. 131 (PDF numbering) is useful.
	-I don't especially like giving differing amounts to different people (_maybe_ for out-of-session
	 work), but 2 pts. to both does feel reasonaby justified after the prelude.
	-Opted for 3.
-First story:
	-Took place October 8th, 1991.
	-Quiana drove, picking up Cade at his studio, along with an enormous painted triptych he made
	 for the occasion.
		-Wesley found a real painting made with blood and semen that he's modeling it after.
			-Has Cade made something like this before? Has it yellowed? Could be mistaken as
			 fitting the fire theme of the event. . .
				-No, he hasn't, so it has indeed yellowed!
		-They parked the car in a garage, roughly a block and a half from the museum.
	-On the way to presentation to Prince Lodin:
		-Confronted by the trio of Dickie (Brujah in my game, instead of Caitiff), Gengis
		 (Brujah), and Marc Levesque (Brujah; "Frenchie", but _hates_ it).
			-Threatening the "baby Cammies":
				""
				"Don't think telling any tales will help you. Your Cammie 'friends' will pounce on
				 any weakness you show."
			-Gengis: "Yeah! You tell him, Dick. . . head.
			 Dickie, sarcastically: ". . . Nice one, dumbshit."
		-Saved by Caitiff, Priscilla/"Madame".
			-Lover of the prince's childe?
				-Ah, maybe claims there's more to why Joseph Peterson is pissed about
				 Quiana than is widely known?
					-Yeah, this is perfect.
				-"Madame" is the perfect person to spred a salacious rumor like this.
			-They heard her referred to as "Pris".
			-Cade said something about "horror" in a thick Scottish accent, leading her to angrily
			 ask, "What did you call me?!?", but they didn't really interrogate the matter and
			 figure out how they'd given offense, instead quickly moving on.
		-They heard the names "Marc" and Gengis and Marc's "French" accent.
		-They saw Dickie Obfuscated as a black man, though did hear the "Dick. . . head" bit.
	-Presentation to the prince:
		-Hosted at the Art Institute, in a large gallery filled, for the occasion, with paintings
		 of flames and, especially, burning cities.
		-Upon entering the room, have the PCs roll Perception + Empathy _and_ Perception +
		 Ettiquette to get information about the people present.
		-Quiana is loathed by Prince Lodin and Joseph Peterson, due to Tremere maneuvering
		 around her Embrace.
		-Only other Tremere present will be Garwood Marshall.
			-This event is more about the general public than the Primogen so Nicolai feels no
			 need to be present, and he and DuSable would rather let Quiana suffer the
			 brunt of the Ventrues' displeasure over their scheme.
			-Garwood will be socializing with his bandmates, Sophia (Toreador stripper), and 
			 maybe Annabelle.
				-Damien might hit on Quiana.
			-Quiana should recognize him.
				-In fact, she went up and talked to him even before introducing herself to Prince
				 Lodin, which he had to sort of push her to go do.
				-Damien did indeed hit on her, and was the only other member of Baby Chorus she
				 managed to exchange introductions with before her presentation.
		-Ventrue present:
			-Lodin, of course.
				-His Status is obvious from both how his broods are arranged around him and by the
				 near-throne on which he sits.
					-A Knowledge or other roll related to the arts (or maybe Chicago) would identify
					 this and much of the rest of the furnishings as objects from the Institute's
					 collections.
					-An _especially_ good roll would identify other bits as _not_ from the
					 collection, or anywhere else you know, but being of _at least_ as lavish
					 quality.
			-Capone:
				-No roll necessary here: there are at least 5 spots within a block where you could
				 buy a t-shirt with his face on it, and he has taken to playing up the gangster
				 aesthetic even more than he did in life.
			-Joseph Peterson:
				-Quiana should recognize him, having interacted with him at least briefly before
				 her embrace.
			-Kevin Jackson:
				-Red suit, surrounded by black kine showing the same gang colors.
			-Horatio and Lawrence Ballard:
				-Perception + Alertness to notice a family resemblence.
				-Perception + Empathy to notice the power relationship.
				-Either way, Horatio's corpulence certainly stands out.
			-Alan Sovereign waiting on Horatio.
			-Edward Neally waiting on Lodin.
			-Schumpter and Thornhill are circulating, while Bobby Weatherbottom stands alone in one
			 corner.
		-Rolls:
			-Quiana and Cade each got 3 or 4 successes on their Perception + Alertness and Perception
			 + Empathy rolls (one each on each, and with opposite results, Alertness vs. Empathy, but
			 I don't remember who was which). Close enough that they both get similar info in both
			 categories.
		-Maureen O'Leary attends, wheeled in by Son and escorted by Ventrue goons.
			-I don't think Cade's actual clan will be known. . . but Malkavians have ways
			 of knowing things. . .
			-Ah, made the date October 8th, the anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire and the
			 one day Prince Lodin forces O'Leary to attend to him, rather than avoiding him at
			 all costs.
			-After being wheeled in shortly after the PCs, her eyes kept coming back to Cade, when
			 they weren't jerking around to many different points of the room looking for threats.
			-Son was rather offputting to Cade (one success on the humanity roll) and Quiana
			 recognized him for the stone-cold psychopath he is (six successes!).
		-Prince will certainly snub Quiana, and maybe Cade by association.
			-They actually ended up presenting separately, Quiana delaying the event as much as
			 possible, but Cade walking up very shortly after entering, almost as fast as he could
			 drag his enormous triptych (that Quiana had stopped helping carry to talk with Garwood)
			 over.
				-It actually went rather well, with the Prince remarking that Queen Anne (Prince of
				 London) was a dear friend of his (after hearing Cade had arrived from there) and
				 mostly appreciating Cade's artwork.
					-He commented that it was a bit abstract for his taste, but the yellowing had
					 served Cade well and he said he appreciated the "flame" motif on the occasion.
					-He directed one of his besuited goons to find a place to hang it in the gallery
					 for the event.
			-Lodin indeed snubbed Quiana, giving quite the cold reception despite her fawning display
			 of humility.
				-She then attempted (hard) to converse with Joseph Peterson, ignoring him turning
				 his back to her and trying to insist, only for him to shout angrily at her to "Get
				 the fuck away from me!"
					-I wonder if she believed Priscilla at face value. . .
				-It was then that the Prince intervened again, telling her to leave Mr. Peterson
				 alone and go stand with the other rabble, pointing at the Caitiff.
			-Used this as an opportunity to push Quiana toward the Caitiff.
				-"Stand with the rabble, and leave Mr. Peterson be. . ."
				-Priscilla/"Madame" will be there with them, and she's almost a friendly face
				 for them by this point, hopefully.
					-Gordon Keaton will be there too, and they should both see mistreatment of
					 her by them ("Whore") and her fawning over him.
		-Introduced Desmond Lee at the same time:
			-Coming from Corpus Christi, "fleeing" the Sabbat.
			-Cashing in some boon to settle (publicly!) in Chicago.
				-Boon held by "Brandon McCarthy".
				-Delivered to Lodin the colonel's insignia Lodin brandished about in Vera Cruz.
			-Recognized by Wolf Pack member.
				-Tyrus, their leader, said he remembered meeting McCarthy there when last they rode
				 through, and thought he saw Des there too.
				-They visited _due_ to it's impending danger from The Sabbat.
			-Drove him off with the smell of garlic, due to Horatio Ballard eating.
				-Limits initial familiarity with the stranger, while also showing off Ballard's
				 disgusting talent.
					-Had some mortal who shows a family resemblance, to Horatio and Lawrence both,
					 deliver it, to wedge in another detail.
				-Mentioned, mostly to Rohit, the smell of the food, wedging garlic in among the
				 various Italian food spices, and also mentioned garlic bread, but he didn't seem
				 to pick up on the carefully disguised significance.
		-Cade approached Kevin Jackson.
			-He introduced himself (though Jackson seemed to know who he was) and rather graciously
			 thanked Jackson for his help.
			-He mentioned an interest in moving "product" of his own, but, once he made it clear
			 he was referring to his _art_, Jackson pointed Cade at his "fellow Toreador".
		-So Cade then approached Annabelle Treabelle and her clique.
			-She was carefully escorted by Bret.
			-She took the opportunity to display scorn for the Caitiff.
			-She extended an invitation to Cade to a party later, at her mansion.
				-She emphasized the word "mansion". . .
				-She's clearly sniffing around Cade to use him as a potential new
				 novelty to spice up her parties.
				-She gave the date as 10/12, two hours after sundown, and had Brett give Cade her
				 "calling card".
				-She also told him to bring a guest.
			-Complemented the triptych and it's right-on-theme nature (apparently).
				-"The flames and. . . *sniff* commemorating the. . . seminal moment of the
				  Prince's reign. . . It's. . . *chef's kiss*"
			-"This city needed some new excitement. Why, I was bored enough attend Drummond's
			  _railroad_ exhibition last month. . ."
				-It was an opportunity to plant a seed that could be used if I run the "Anabelle's
				 Party" story from Succubus Club.
			-Her clique there:
				-Bret
				-Sophia
				-Michael
		-Maureen O'Leary examined Cade and babbled at him.
			-Son wheeled her over to her, standing with Michael Payne (who beat a hasty retreat
			 while she was focused on Cade and holding his head in place.)
			-Who else is with them?
				-Eh, probably no one else. The Smiths rarely leave the asylum and the others
				 are not strongly associated with the inmates.
			-Cade should be subjected uncomfortable examination by O'Leary: lots of
			 staring and face touching.
				-Afterwards, she should seem satisfied, maybe with a knowing nod, but mostly
				 speak gibberish.
				-Phrases used:
					"Artist who changes people. . . who changed. . ."
					"What is that infernal racket?!?"
					"Pale of skin. . . dark of vein. Kin and kindred. . ."
				-Cade successfully made a(n easy) Willpower roll after his clanmate hinted she
				 recognized the relation.
		-Quiana got to spend a lot of time talking with the Caitiff.
			-She met:
				Gordon
				Priscilla
					-Quiana called her Pris, but was corrected: "Pri_scilla_, but you can call me
					 Madam."
					-Rohit got a strong sense of Pris's bond, even asking what sort of spell she was
					 under.
						-I played it up pretty hard, with her fawning over Gordon despite abuse
						 hurled her way, but playing it a mix of mean and cool towards everyone else.
				Cally
					-Described with "housewife dressed up for night out", "JC Penny dress".
				Matt
					-Described with long, greasy hair and a beat-up leather jacket.
				Fred
					-He didn't say a word to her, and quickly fled when Jackson's men eventually
					 approached. She and Des only got his name from Matt.
				Eventually, Des
			-Des was long on "us", "clanless" (not Caitiff), and pride.
				-Gordon left shortly after he arrived, in part due to the implied familiarity, and
				 implying he's as low as the rest of the Caitiff.
					-He went to go talk to Garwood.
				-Matt eventually corrected his assumption that Quiana was a Caitiff.
				-Des displayed some alarm at that, but was interrupted by the smell of Ballard's
				 dinner.
				-I certainly played up his disgust, and carefully had it begin when the _smell_
				 began, before Ballard began eating, but also threw in a lot of chaff concerning
				 how the various Kindred present found Ballard's eating disgusting too.
				-As he left, he choked out a invitation to all there (though he probably didn't
				 mean to extend it to Quiana) to meet him at The Succubus Club sometime.
			-Quiana then asked the Caitiff a variety of questions.
				-Why the Caitiff were held in such low esteem.
				-Who various people were, and what Clans they represented, including:
					-Baby Chorus
						-Only learned Damien's clan.
					-The Wolf Pack
					-Jackson and his men.
		-Kevin Jackson, noticing the attention from Quiana and the Caitiff, sent two of his men
		 over to collect Quiana.
			-She did make a somewhat sly attempt to pin the debt on Cade, but he responded that he
			 had it "on a good authority that _she_ made the call."
				-She mentioned she gave the drugs to Cade which met with, "Well, I hope he knows
				 how much he owes you, then, but that doesn't change what _you_ owe."
			-He mentioned an interest in Tremere shit: "A lot you can do with a witch. . ."
			-He also generally suggested (in a suggestive fashion) that she find ways to be useful.
			-She did offer a bit of her journalist role, though he didn't really bite.
		-Cade was asked by Joseph Peterson to address a Masquerade violation.
			-Tied to the art world, it's a filmmaker creating problematic films.
			-"He's very much your sort of _degenerate_ art. . ." with a glance at the triptych.
				-There was another easily passed Willpower role.
			-The filmmaker's name is Arthur Webb.
			-"Here's your opportunity to associate with a better class of Kindred. . . and do a
			  favor for one."
				-JP also sort of name dropped Lodin, implying some gratitude there too.
			-Cade expressed not-quite-feigned interest in what Peterson was selling, and agreed to
			 the plan.
			-Peterson gave him a business card, asking him to call and let him know when the matter
			 had been dealt with.
			-Cade shared this with Quiana in the car on the way home.
		-They both then spent some time talking with Baby Chorus.
			-Cade went over first, followed a little while later by Quiana.
			-Mentioned Succubus Club.
			-Told Cade about a gig at Blue Velvet on Friday.
			-Keaton was still there.
				-When Cade walked up, he heard Keaton and Garwood discussing a deal for blood, and
				 sending "two girls" over to the chantry.
				-Once Quiana arrived, Keaton said something about maybe seeing her around the chantry,
				 then left.
					-That prompted some questions for Garwood, who said, "Keaton is a resourceful
					 man. Resources The Pyramid can use. And you know well that Clan Tremere has a
					 lot to offer.
			-Both met all of the band, and got some sense of what's going on with Ray.
				-Space-cadet-y most of the time, but they saw flickers of other behavior, and Ray
				 even introduced himself to Quiana as Cliff, with a firm handshake.
				-Questions were mostly met with "Leave Ray alone. . ." and, once, "Also, stay away
				 from Cliff."
			-Quiana later got an invite to the gig too.
				-They both heard a bit of discussion amongst the band about the upcoming gig,
				 including Kathy saying, "Yeah, and the hands off management is nice, compared to
				 that shitheel Thornhill."
			-Quiana made a decent impression on Kathy, who was unusually forthcoming, and gave
			 Quiana a run down, particularly concerning the Toreador.
		-(DIDN'T HAPPEN!) Edward Neally would be a good option if Quiana continues to attempt to harrass the prince.
			-His inherent morality is good enough reason to intervene, though it's also the actions
			 of the good servant he is.
			-It's a good opportunity to put that decency on display, for later use. . .
		-Interacting with the Ballards:
			 -Cade approached them, fishing for a commission.
			 -Horatio was polite, if a bit dismissive, though he never stopped eating.
			 -After Cade walked away, both of our Auspex-equipped PCs heard Horatio whisper to
			  Lawrence," We saw Mr. Hall talking with Jackson. Find out what their relationship is. . ."
			  	-Horatio being a major rival of Capone, he sees opportunity in Capone and Jackson's
				 incipent rivalry and is looking for openings to exploit related to that..
			 	-Further discussion of a commission could be an opportunity to talk more about
				 Jackson, etc.?
		-(DIDN'T HAPPEN!) Khalid or another Nosferatu gently interrogating Quiana would also be an option.
			-Especially useful if she's floundering a bit, given all the cold shoulders and her (at
			 time of writing) separation from the more approachable Cade.
			-Khalid certainly is curious about why she was made, given that it has signs of a shift
			 in power and allegiances amongst he Prince and Primogen.
			-Hmm. . . Khalid rarely reveals himself to non-Nosferatu Kindred, but none of the other
			 Nosferatu are really suitable for this.
				-I was figuring he'd appear Masked, but I guess he will do so only if unobserved and
				 not reveal much of himself.
		-Followed home by bloods?
			-Perception + Alertness to detect.
				-They both rolled 3 successes and spotted a beat up Cadillac that seemed to be
				 following them since the Loop.
			-Quiana took the car _past_ the exit for Cade's Wicker Park studio.
			-She then turned around at a random exit, getting back on the Kennedy, both making it
			 clear the PCs were being followed and that they knew it.
			-She eventually managed to lose them, after _a lot_ of risky maneuvering on both cars
			 parts, lost them, when they T-boned cross traffic in a rather dramatic wreck that
			 Quiana drove off from.
			-Where does Quiana head back to?
				-If she _eventually_ goes back to the condo, well, they can wait patiently if need
				 be, though that may open more opportunities to learn about the tail, before or
				 after making it home.
				-She went back to the chantry, shaking a bit and covered in blood-sweat.
			-DIDN'T HAPPEN (yet?):
				-If so, _both_ of them will eventually have a package waiting for them one evening.
					-Inside are three bricks, labeled K, C, and H, along with a paper heart, in blood
					 red, labeled KJ.
-Post-presentation stuff to talk about:
	-Humanity roll for the accident?
		-Eh, it's on the border of what would call for it, and the rulebook explicitly recommends
		 warning before making players roll.
		-So, maybe just discuss it.
	-Remind folks that spending blood for physical stats is a thing! Could have been handy in the
	 chase, if any of us had thought of it.
-Second story:
	-Arthur Webb's films, a Masquerade violation:
		-The PCs discussed this in the car on the way home from The Art Institute, making plans to
		 look into the matter the next night.
			-Quiana does have a _job_ though. . .
		-Due to Quiana's job, Cade was able to investigate first, going to a Wicker Park video store
		 recommended by Earl.
			-Earl, a member of Cade's herd, is a big guy and watches the place for Cade while he
			 sleeps.
			-He got a copy of Webb's movie there, brought it home, and watched the (terrible) movie.
			-I failed to include any mention of arcane symbols or the like, sadly, in my description
			 of the movie.
			-I _did_ include mention of vampire feeding scenes and a Caine & Abel scene implying
			 Caine was a vampire.
				-The Caine bit on it's own may be enough to work in mentions of the "Phoenecian
				 inscription" bits below.
		-Quiana met Cade at her apartment after work.
			-Scanned the room with Aura Perception, botched, and thought all of the herd were ghouls.
		-She fed on a man there named Johnny, sleeping with him in Cade's dark room and getting his
		 number.
		-Quiana then went back to the chantry for the evening, where she encountered her sire/mentor
		 and asked him about tons of stuff, including:
			-Who the primogen of the city are.
			-Gordon Keaton, Pris, and the blood bond:
				-She now has a good idea of how blood bonds work and what's going on there.
			-What she should study further (being told the basics of Thaumaturgy and Occult).
		-They were planning on going to the Thursday (10/10/91) showing (of other film) at Music
		 Box, as seen in a card in the VHS tape.
		-Ultimately, Webb saw films by Johann Weltmann, which led Webb down this path.
			-Weltmann's films aren't really a danger to the Masquerade _themselves_, instead
			 brushing up against concepts and themes adjacent to _Golconda_.
			-That, though, led Webb to do further research, and start incorporating more
			 obviously problematic concepts in his own films.
				- "resisting dark, bestial urges ; I mean ; vampires were a natural fit!"
			-But, that wouldn't necessarily mean a ruthless PC couldn't use the link to
			 make trouble for Weltmann.
			-On the other hand, a differently disposed PC could use this to pick up the
			 trail of Golconda. . .
			-Weltmann is just generally a fantastic NPC for Cade to interact with.
		-What Webb knows about Weltmann:
			-Weltmann's later films are the ones that included this theme of "enlightenment".
				-His films aren't obviously dated, but content and production techniques (though
				 they're all black and white) enable strong guesses.
			-Webb is unsure if he's still alive, but he'd be pushing 100 if so. . .
			-Weltmann's relevant films:
				-One about a over-sexed, cheating man who meets someone he desires greatly, only
				 for her to die (tied to some action of his?) leading to increased depravity but
				 decreased satisfaction, and eventually happiness only when he repents to those
				 harmed and abandons desire.
				-Stop motion film of a raging, wolf-like creature violently gobbling down small
				 creatures, bloating further and further, until they're all explosively expelled
				 forth, alive and whole, leaving a more dog-like creature that goes and lies down
				 with the flock of sheep he now guards.
					-Colorized blood?
					-"The Beast of Hunger"
				- climbing mountain, pulling others down along the way ; tumbling again back down again and again ; making peace with the others ; buoyed up by them to enlightenment
					-"Holy Mountain"
		-Hmm. . . occult symbolism and the like might be a way to push Cade to draw Quiana
		 into this. . .
		-Webb's inspiration from Weltmann's films lead to him drawing on other inspiration with more
		 explicit ties to the Kindred, and thus more overtly endangering The Masquerade.
			-It was something at the University of Chicago, Webb's alma mater.
				-An opportunity to involve Critias?
			-While a student there, he encountered a misfiled document, a translation of a
			 fragmentary Phoenecian inscription encountered during a North African expedition
			 financed by the university's Oriental Institute in the 50's.
				-It described the blood tithe due "Ba'al" (sometimes a god, but originally a word
				 simply meanng "lord"), "as his father's father's father" *illegible inscription*
				 "after his parents left the garden."
				-My intended implication is a reference to Caine and a "lord" of the 4th generation.
					-_Menele's_ generation. . .
				-As such, Critias would _certainly_ be very interested in this document, and I'm
				 intending to imply he might have been involved in sending the expedition out in the
				 first place.
				-Webb doesn't know where this document is. . . but knows where it _was_, and could
				 offer clues to finding it.
			-The vampire link to Weltmann's films was Webb's invention, but it reminded him of _this_
			 vampire-related experience from his past.
		-Webb's film then depicts Caine, already a vampire, murdering his brother, in a scene Webb
		 saw as like the bestial urge Weltmann's films played with trenscending.
			-"The Beast Within"
		-Cade began Thursday night by going out to eat, at Blue Velvet.
			-Though there was no line, he still encountered slightly weirdness from the bouncer, who
			 stared at him for a moment before ushering him inside.
			-There he saw Matt, who he recognized from the event at The Art Institute.
			-He approached Matt and Matt pointed out a blood doll to Cade, explaining the subculture
			 and saying someone must have done a fucking number on that lot.
			-He said she looked too young for him to pull, but that Cade might have some luck talking
			 her into an easy snack for them both.
			-Cade indeed managed to catch her interest and led her off to the single occupency
			 bathrooms to share blood.
			-Cade managed to feed, getting three blood points, but was then interrupted by Matt
			 banging on the door looking for "Scotty", having not gotten Cade's name.
			-Cade opened the door and acknowledged he knew Matt to the girl who increasingly freaked
			 out as Matt barged in.
			-She eventually grabbed the razor she'd used to open her wrist and started brandishing
			 it at them, but Cade calmed her with Dementation.
			-Matt then seized the opportunity to feed and, Cade knowing he'd taken as much blood as
			 was safe, uncomfortably ducked out and left the establishement to find a pay phone.
		-Cade then attended the Thursday night indie screening at The Music Box, as advertised in
		 that tape of Webb's film.
			-He tried calling Quiana at her condo but got her machine, leaving a message, as she
			 stayed the night at the chantry (and Cade doesn't have a number for it).
			-Quiana, meanwhile, called Cade's studio after he'd already left, getting an incoherently
			 intoxicated member of Cade's heard, but gave up after that in favor of spending the
			 night studying Thaumaturgy.
				-(Despite an explicit, out of character warning that this was likely to lead to a
				  boring session, but Rohit was insistent that Quiana didn't care much about the
				  whole affair and wasn't going to go any further out of her way to join in.)
			-So Cade took a cab up and bought a ticket for the showing.
			-Once inside, he found that it wasn't Webb's movie playing tonight, but did manage to
			 meet the guy who made _this_ film, Trapped, who was named John Delany.
				-Asking John if the movie tonight was The Beast Within, John explained no, but
				 mentioned that it had played four weeks ago and he knew Webb, who frequently
				 attended the indie night.
				-Cade asked John to point him out if Webb arrived, but, despite nodding along, John
				 was quickly distracted by others interested in _his_ movie.
				-Near the time the film began to play, Cade, watching the theater, saw someone he
				 thought he recognized from Webb's movie.
				-I described John's movie as that trapped in an elevator movie I saw years back.
				-During the Q&A afterwards, the guy Cade thought he recognized asked a question of
				 John, who addressed the guy as Art.
				-Cade then took the opportunity to go speak to the man, who he quickly confirmed was
				 Arthur Webb.
					-He heard from Webb about Weltmann, his films, how he'd be pushing 100 if he
					 was still alive, and that he was from Chicago.
					-Webb also mentioned that any store carrying his movie was likely to have some
					 of Weltmann's.
					-Webb also briefly alluded to some document at the The University of Chicago,
					 his alma mater, that inspired the vampire theme, though that the theme was his
					 own original twist on Weltmann's enlightenment theme.
					-Cade also mentioned that he was an artist, intriguing Webb, who gave Cade his
					 number, and Cade ("Kate?") reciprocated, saying, "Stop by my studio any time,
					 and see my work."
			-Leaving the theater and heading for a bus stop, Cade witnessed Son's assault on Cally.
				-Son was using his Dominate to prevent Cally from fleeing, while cutting her arms
				 with a knife.
				-Cade intervened, kicking unsuccessfully and then Dread Gazing should Son turn around.
				-Son instead fled, disappearing behind a building and being apparently gone
				 (Obfuscated) when Cade ran forward to where he could see past the building's corner.
				-Cade then caught up with Cally.
					-She recognized her rescuer from the event at the museum and eventually calmed
					 a bit.
					-Though she'd healed the cuts on her arms, her clothes were covered in blood and,
					 looking down at the mess, she said, "Shit! I can't go home like this! my husband
					 already thinks I'm having an affair, but this. . ."
					-She also added, ". . . and I'm _so_ hungry. . ."
				-Cade offered her his blood and she drank some from his wrist, neither realizing the
				 significance.
					-She fed more than Cade wanted to give. He failed to push her off, but she
					 eventually stopped on her own, leaving Cade uncomfortably hungry himself.
				-No longer hungry, she was then even more preoccupied with how she was going to go 
				 home.
 				-She gave Cade "a friend's" number and Cade walked off to find a payphone.
					-Calling, it turned out to be Matt Fisher, who picked them up in a car he clearly
					 had little experience driving after Cade told him Cally needed help.
					-Cade mentioned he was hungry and Matt offered a solution to both problems: he
					 dropped Cade off at a bar, suggesting that he go find a snack _and_ steal a coat
					 that would cover the blood all over Cally.
					-Cade successfully executed that plan, luring again with his Jackson-provided
					 drugs.
				-Cade gave both Cally and Matt his number.
				-Cally had Matt drop her off some distance from home, walking the rest of the way.
				-Matt asked if Cade was going to Blue Velvet tomorrow, mentioning he'd be there for
				 the Baby Chorus gig.
				-Cade, seemingly following Cally's lead, had Matt drop him off at the six corners
				 intersection, rather than directly at home.
		-We left off a bit after midnight on Thursday, with Wesley talking about whether or not the
		 video store is likely to be open.
			-Weltmann's films, should he manage to get copies, are far better than Webb's (and
			 detailed somewhere above).
			-Also now a chance to insert occult symbolism as a Quiana/Tremere tie-in!
		-Cade fed at a nearby bar and then headed home.
	-Baby Chorus gig at Blue Velvet on Friday, 10/11/91:
		-Cally called Cade early that evening.
			-Extremely early, the first time, before Cade was awake, and then calling again later.
				-Emphasized this aspect of Humanity, and Cally's high humanity.
			-And emphasized the start of the bond. . .
			-Thanked him profusely, and also expressed concern about what she's going to do from here.
			-They talked about what to do about Son, and where the Malkavians stay ("an asylum. . .
			 but I don't know which.").
			-Cade mentioned the Baby Chorus gig, and they ended up planning to both go.
				-Cally mentioned she thinks Ray may be a Malkavian, though Cade didn't want anything
				 to do with him and seemed creeped out by what he'd seen before.
				-Cade mentioned he was planning on going with Quiana and needed to talk to her.
				-Cally gave Cade her number, to call her back and let her know the plan.
				-After Quiana called him from a payphone, he did call back. . . and her jealous
				 husband answered.
					-Cally eventually pulled the phone from him, but I think Cade got a sense of the
					 issues there.
			-Cally met Cade by the North Ave. Blue Line and they got cab from there to the gig.
		-Quiana woke earlier and grabbed a snack in a nearby alley.
			-She then called Cade from that payphone and headed to the club, so was already there
			 when Cade and Cally arrived.
			-She knows the bouncer, Ian Gibson, by name, and he knows hers.
			-Gibson gave her a VIP pass and she asked him to look out for a man of Cade's
			 description, Gibson remembering him from his arrival last night.
		-Cade rolled fantastically on Perception and so spotted the following Kindred he recognized:
			-Matt, standing near the bathrooms.
			-Damien, in a booth with several young women.
			-Garwood and Kathy talking, just backstage, still visible from the the floor.
		-Cade and Cally met up with Quiana in the VIP section.
			-Cade mentioned to the other two who he saw tonight, and his past encounter with Matt
			 here.
		-Cade and Cally then went to go talk to Matt.
			-Cally scolded him for what Cade told her about the previous night here.
			-Cade _did_ admit to drinking a bit much before Matt had his agreed upon turn. . .
			-Eventually, Matt proposed grabbing "another drink" together, to which Cade agreed.
				-Cally responded by storming off, heading back towards the VIP stairs.
				-They cornered an awkward and chubby college student, who'd been playing wallflower,
				 and led the poor man off to the bathrooms with promises of "the best drugs".
					-"You'll see purple orangutans!" Matt colorfully promised.
					-That succeeded mostly due to their force of will and his shyness, the vessel
					 seemingly being inexperienced with the subject (though he asked something to
					 the effect of, "And this will make me cool?").
				-There Cade floundered a bit, but Matt took the lead, instructing the poor guy to
				 stare at the mirror while Matt did something to his wrist.
					-Prefacing it with, "You afraid of needles? Keep looking at the mirror!', Matt
					 drank from his wrist, then passed it to Cade.
				-As Cade finished up, Matt then spun the man, yelling, "See! Purple orangutan!"
				-And, indeed, as Cade looked up, there _was_ a purple orangutan, crouching on the
				 toilet seat and beating his chest, albeit one that looked pretty far from real.
				-Matt then pulled Cade out the door and they ran out into the crowd laughing as the
				 guy fell to his knees on the filthy bathroom floor yelling about the orangutan.
				-Cade, mildly shaken but seeing the humor in this all, expressed interest in learning
				 this trick (a thing he'd never heard of), and Matt said that might be possible.
				-They then headed back up the VIP stairs.
		-Tamoszius may be at the gig somewhere.
			-He has Auspex 2 and can learn what Cade did. . .
			-Quiana spotted his as he sat at a table on the balcony near her.
				-Staring, as she noticed, at the group of Cade, Cally, and Matt below.
			-She went to talk to him.
			-She established he's Kathy's sire (having recognized his name after someone at the
			 fire anniversary party mentioned it).
			-He established that Quiana is new, and that she knows Cade, newly arrived from London.
			-He warned her that the story of Cade's past holds some dark twist.
			-They also discussed Anabelle's party.
				-He informed her that he'd be there as well.
				-He mentioned it would be a mix of Kindred and Kine, and mentioned Anabelle's husband.
			-They also discussed Maria's absence, in relation to Anabelle's prominence, and expressed
			 interest should Quiana learn more about the subject.
			-Cally eventually joined them, though Tamoszius took his leave before Matt and Cade also
			 made their way up.
		-A short while later, they left Matt holding the table with it's excellent view and went
		 down to greet Damien, ensconed in a booth with three young women.
			-He proposed to all six of them more partying after the gig, maybe heading to the
			 Succubus Club.
				-He asked the kine with him if they'd ever been to the labryinth in the basement.
			-Eventually, he left for backstage, and Quiana took the opportunity to feed from one of
			 the young women, partly employing her "on TV" fame.
				-She scared the other two off in the course of it, with what sounded to everyone
				 but Rohit's ears like she was trying to Harvey Weinstein them.
				-Ultimately (and supposedly all along) she took a page from Cade's book (and a baggie
				 from his hand), luring her to the bathroom with drugs.
				-He concealed the feeding with Dominate 3. . . but did give her the ketamine too.
				-He then led her, woozy and loopy, back to the booth where Cade and Cally waited.
		-They stayed for the set, and I tried to impress on them that the band is good, slightly
		 political, and at least a bit problematically "fight the power".
		-Afterwards, Garwood approached them in the booth, having seen Quiana, but the woozy Damien
		 groupy soon drove him off with questions about her boy rocker king.
		-ENDED: After the gig, coterie and Cally having approached Ray, Damien later joining them.
			-He greeted them in his Bruce persona, and seemed very interested in Cade, though the
			 bartender referred to him as Lawrence and he responded when Damien greeted him as Ray.
			-Before launching into a discussion of their set with Damien (despite apparently being
			 unaware of being in the band in discussions with the coterie moments before), he said
			 something about feeling like he knew Cade, like there was "a connection" there, a thing
			 that forced Cade to roll his Willpower.
			-He failed that Willpower roll, getting zero successes but not botching.
				- TODO: So, what exactly does that lead to?
		-End up at Succubus club after?
			-Damien would go, and probably some of the others. Got the impression in one book or
			 another that Kathy has an issue with it, but maybe that's just _playing_ there.
				-Lure the kine he's with into the labryinth
			-Good opportunity to run into Des and some of the caitiff (Matt is easiest candidate).
			-Des would be _very_ interested in word of Pris's plight or an assault by Son on a
			 Caitiff.
			-Can I work Fred into this? If not, how later?
				-
			-Gengis could be there too.
				-Slam dancing!
				-Great opportunity for a mention of Pris.
			-A run-in with Portia too?
		-
	-Anabelle's party at her mansion on Saturday 10/12/91:
		-She's clearly sniffing around Cade to use him as a potential new novelty to spice up her
		 parties.
		-Maybe even have the musician or sculptor mentioned on page 40 of Succubus Club at
		 Anabelle's first party?
			-
		-How can I work Desmond, or other Caitiff, into either party?
			-Cally invited there for mockery?
			-Sophia and/or Brett linked to Pris and the sex trade?
			-Des invited by Anabelle to complete "her trio" of the newest Kindred in the city for
			 the party?
		-The party will draw heavily on the "Annabelle's Party Elite" coterie.
		-
-What are the Caitiff aiming to do?
	-Strike at Neally?
		-A wound to a the prince, but also a rather cruel thing to do.
		-Oh! Both he and Pris have a fondness for opiates, a thing that might offer the Caitiff an
		 opening. . .
	-Import or make others?
		-A (brutal) Pander of Des's past acquaintance?
			-With Quietus. Silently beats people to death.
			-A Pander stereotype: a former streetperson from a mass embrace.
	-Annabelle would also be a reasonable target: she's _very_ much not to the taste of Des and his
	 politics.
	-Longterm:
		-Des is obviously looking to change control of the city. . .
-The Malkavians:
	- confrontation over Son?
	- book says Helena caused Malkavians to light the fire ; mention of voices and the like by O'Leary?
-Are the Methuselahs aware of this new arrival and his plots? What do they think, if so?
