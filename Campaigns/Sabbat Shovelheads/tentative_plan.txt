Characters:
	-Create human characters?
		-No choice of clan or disciplines?
		-Do they get all disciplines at once, or save most for later?
	-Probably at least _offer_ premades
		-That cobbled together Tzimisce is tempting

Episode 1:
	-Newlymade shovelheads
	-Sent, as part of a crusade, to attack some Camarilla vampire
		-Probably not expected back
		-Maybe your Ventrue?
		-Assamite Antribu giving the mission?
	-If it's a success, who survives is lauded somewhat
		-Came back from a suicide mission, after all
		-If the whole party comes back, that's why they're kept together
			-True even if it's only _most_ of the party
		-Casualties can be offered new premades, or a chance to make a replacement
			-Premade options are good, in case it's mid-session or some such

Downtime:
	-On the road and in training
	-Use your various characters as NPCs, offering interesting disciplines and such
	-Maybe let players spend remaining freebie points, as well as XP?
		-Or give freebie points _instead_ of XP for first episode?

Episode 2:
	-In hiding
		-Dumped in small mountain pass town, told to lay low and wait for orders
	-The town has local anarchs
		-Patriarch is a Brujah who came through with group of hippies in the 60's
			-Redneck-y town drove off the hippies, but he stayed
		-Has a childe or two, passionate anarchs
		-Also has a Malkavian groupie and her childe, his fan club
			-The childe might mention a blood bond, possibly in relation to loyalty of party
				-He weirdly romanticizes it, and would accept it from his sire or patriarch
	-There is also a Tremere chantry, up in the hills
		-Could serve as a target for a mission from anarchs _or_ sabbat

Episode 3:
	-The battle of Los Angeles
	-Depends a lot on who they're loyal to, which'll affect what they do here and how they go here
	-Maybe battle an elder
		-Ankaran Sarcophagus?
		-Cap the game with a total party kill, lol
