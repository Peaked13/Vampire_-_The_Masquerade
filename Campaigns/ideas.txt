-Sabbat Shovelheads
	-Has it's own folder already.
-How the Sword of Caine Saved Christmas:
	-Shamelessly stolen from a comment here, and ideas for implementing it abound throughout the
	 post: https://old.reddit.com/r/vtm/comments/1gxej9u/idea_for_a_holiday_one_shot_someone_kidnaps_the/
-Pander Evangelist antagonist:
	-Story beats, in order:
		-Build sympathy for the caitiff:
			-Caitiff rescue from Brujah thugs?
				-"Prince Lodin's childe's lover", "Didn't do it for you"/boon
				-Anarch vs. Camarilla a factor in this harrassment?
					-Oh! The Nihilist Anarch coterie is very into this kind of thing with young,
					 Camarilla-affiliated Kindred.
						-Coterie summary on pg. 160 of CBN.
						-Dickie is a solid candidate, who loathes the Camarilla, but is a Caitiff
						 himself.
							-Could easily change him to Brujah, though.
							-The wanted by Lodin aspect could be an issue, though.
						-Gengis is a decent candidate, and even the book is unclear on whether he's
						 Caitiff or Brujah.
						-Levesque is probably to suave for the purpose, but his hat for the Sheriff
						 easily could transfer to Cammies in general.
						-Damien is a bit better, but not by much.
						-The rest, Euclid and Neon, are more the kind of charity cases I want to
						 portray the Caitiff as.
			-Alternately, if unsympathetic, this story is going to be about learning to regret that,
			 and the danger that even the downtrodden can pose if united/empowered.
		-Presentation to the Prince:
			-Featuring scorn demonstrated for the caitiff, somewhere in the social occasion.
			-
		-Deal with Masquerade violation:
			-Tasked by the Prince at presentation.
				-Partial recompense for granting sires permission to embrace the players?
			-
		-Witness Caitiff abuse, by Son?
			-If brought to Prince Lodin's court, O'Leary and Paula Smith should rescue Son, maybe
			 with Ben Smith too, avoiding any consequence for Son.
			-In CbN 2nd Ed., Son has killed Neon, but fucking with Neon would provoke major rage
			 from  Damien. Some other target is probably better.
			-Maybe an invented Caitiff?
		-
	-Set in Chicago:
		-Chicago By Night has the city the site of a lot of Camarilla vs. Anarch conflicts, though
		 I can easily set it in any minima or maxima in that conflict.
		 -Yeah, lets set it some time on, with Anarchs in an even worse spot.
		-Let coterie see "Son" preying on Caitiff, then protected by O'Leary and Lodin?
			-Yes! Given his openness to the Sabbat, our Evangelist could even be seen later to reign
			 him in a bit in a way that Camarilla elders were unable to, building some respect for 
			 the Evangelist in the players. . . before his secret is revealed.
		-Fate of the printed Sabbat coterie:
			-Their uprising was thwarted, with Wendy Wade destroyed in the process and Phillipe
			 captured.
				-Chicago Kindred would describe Wade, if at all, as the typically senselessly
				 violent Masquerade risk that they'd stereotype all Sabbat as.
				-Phillipe is staked, his capture known only to Lodin and a trusted lieutenant or
				 two.
					-He was already the same generation as Lodin, so maybe up that by one to explain
					 why Dominate hasn't gotten anything from him yet, and why he's kept around
					 until perhaps it could.
						-After all, a Sabbat of such high generation?!?
						-Perhaps Phillipe even got that extra bump from diablerie in Chicago?
				-Tyler's past was never revealed, but Phillipe did reach out to her, and she now
				 lives in fear it _was_ revealed (and would be very alarmed to learn Phillipe wasn't
				 destroyed).
				-Son's contact with them also went unknown to the rest of Chicago.
					-He's perhaps concerned that his involvement could hurt them, but not at all
					 turned off by their revealed affiliation.
		-Utility of existing Caitiff:
			-
	-Invent more Caitiffs:
		-Ideally some pathetic ones. . .
		-
	-Set one or more of coterie up for the bond?
		-Ignorantly falling into it is a common them in Chicago by Night.
	-Set in 1991.
		-Initially figured the current year.
			-Good time for the old socialists and the like among the anarchs to hav been crushed. . .
		-On the other hand, setting well in the past, like the year Chicago by Night was written,
		 offers lots of room to stretch the game over without doing science fiction.
		-Yeah, talked with the players and they're good with starting in '91, the publication date
		 of the first Chicago by Night.
	-Players:
		-Rohit:
			-Clan Tremere.
			-TV journalist and gambler.
			-Family money.
			-Physical character sheet.
			-Sire is Abraham DuSable.
				-TODO: What race is the PC? DuSable probably has strong feeling about the subject. . .
			-Why did Prince Lodin grant permission for his embrace?
				-I don't think he knew exactly who the target was.
				-But open ended permission might even be a _bigger_ ask. . .
		-Wesley:
			-Clan Malkavian, but is under the delusion he is a Toreador.
				-A kind of multiple personality disorder.
			-Abstract painter and performance artist, throwing paint on models.
				-Feeds from his models too.
			-New to the city (from outside the country?).
				-In fact, that's the reason for his association with Rohit. Someone paid his way in
				 boons to get to the city, and get set up there. At least one such favor called in
				 came from Abraham DuSable, and he's pushing that responsibility of onto Rohit as
				 the cost of his continued patronage of his childe.
			-Wesley was open to the idea of there having once _been_ a Toreador: https://discord.com/channels/@me/1152273978954625064/1323148189460729919
				-Once a promising artist, and an object of envy for TODO: Wesley, now dead by
				 TODO: Wesley's hand with him assuming the identity, to one degree or another.
				-Danced around it with him, but I'm clearly imagining diablerie.
				-Could also explain why "someone powerful paid your way in favors to do so: a
				 promising young Toreador was gone too soon, but here's a Malkavian, admittedly
				 they're murderer, doing they're damndest (heh) to keep that legacy alive (and
				 there's some secrets that might lead an elder vampire to think there might be more
				 to it than just insanity)."
	-Our evangelist:
		-Name given: Desmond Lee
			-Eventually "Des" to those friendly with him.
		-Cashing in some boon to settle (publicly!) in Chicago?
			-Boon held by "Brandon McCarthy"?
			-Delivers to Lodin the colonel's insignia Lodin brandished about in Vera Cruz?
	-First story:
		-On the way to presentation to Prince Lodin:
			-Confronted by the trio of Dickie (Brujah in my game, instead of Caitiff), Gengis
			 (Brujah), and Marc Levesque (Brujah; "Frenchie", but _hates_ it).
				-
				-Gengis: "Yeah! You tell him, Dick. . . head.
				 Dickie, sarcastically: ". . . Nice one, dumbshit."
			-Saved by Caitiff, Priscilla/"Madame".
				-Lover of the prince's childe?
					-Ah, maybe claims there's more to why Joseph Peterson is pissed about
					 TODO: Rohit than is widely known?
						-If his PC is male, old, closeted Republican is a trope.
					-"Madame" is the perfect person to spred a salacious rumor like this.
		-Presentation to the prince:
			-TODO: Rohit is loathed by Prince Lodin and Joseph Peterson, due to TODO: Tremere maneuvering around his Embrace.
			-Introduce Desmond Lee at the same time?
				-
			-Do the Malkavians show?
				-I don't think TODO: Wesley's actual clan will be known. . . but Malkavians have ways of knowing things. . .
				-Ah, make the date October 8th, the anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire and the
				 one day Prince Lodin forces O'Leary to attend to him, rather than avoiding him at
				 all costs?
			-Only other Tremere present will be Garwood Marshall.
				-This event is more about the general public than the Primogen so Nicolai feels no
				 need to be present, and he and DuSable would rather let TODO: Rohit suffer the
				 brunt of the Ventrues' displeasure over their scheme.
				-Garwood will be socializing with his bandmates, Sophia (Toreador stripper), and 
				 maybe Annabelle.
				-TODO: Rohit should recognize him.
			-Prince will certainly snub TODO: Rohit, and maybe TODO: Wesley by association.
				-Use this as an opportunity to push them toward the Caitiff.
					-"Stand with the rabble. I have other business to attend to. . ."?
					-Or simply have those more elite follow the Prince's lead and turn away from them?
					-Priscilla/"Madame" will be there with them, and she's almost a friendly face
					 for them by this point, hopefully.
						-Gordon Keaton will be there too, and they should both see mistreatment of
						 her by them ("Whore") and her fawning over him.
			-Maureen O'Leary and her clanmates should be the first to rescue the PCs from their
			 snubbing.
				-Son wheels her over to them, to examine TODO: Wesley.
					-Remember the Humanity roll in Son's description!
				-Who else is with them?
					-Eh, probably no one else. The Smith's rarely leave the asylum and the others
					 are not strongly associated with the inmates.
				-TODO: Wesley should be subjected uncomfortable examination by O'Leary: lots of
				 staring and face touching.
					-Afterwards, she should seem satisfied, maybe with a knowing nod, but mostly
					 speak gibberish.
					-"Artist who changes people. . ."?
			-Annabelle Treabelle should then use that as giving her leave to approach TODO: Wesley
			 too.
				-Excellent opportunity for her to snub Caitiff and display scorn for them.
				-She'll extend invitations to TODO: Wesley.
					-Both over to her clique in Elysium and to a party later, at her mansion.
						-She should emphasize the word "mansion". . .
						-She's clearly sniffing around TODO: Wesley to use him as a potential new
						 novelty to spice up her parties.
					-The party will draw heavily on the "Annabelle's Party Elite" coterie.
		-Pushed (by who?) to address a Masquerade violation?
			-The Tremere? Joseph Peterson? Someone else at the presentation?
			-Do the Ventrue demand this of _TODO: Wesley_, rather than TODO: Rohit?
				-Something tied to the art world? Filmmaker? (CbN guy ties?)
