-Sabbat Shovelheads
	-Has it's own folder already.
-How the Sword of Caine Saved Christmas:
	-Shamelessly stolen from a comment here, and ideas for implementing it abound throughout the
	 post: https://old.reddit.com/r/vtm/comments/1gxej9u/idea_for_a_holiday_one_shot_someone_kidnaps_the/
-Pander Evangelist antagonist:
	-Story beats, in order:
		-Build sympathy for the caitiff:
			-Caitiff rescue from Brujah thugs?
				-"Prince Lodin's childe's lover", "Didn't do it for you"/boon
				-Anarch vs. Camarilla a factor in this harrassment?
					-Oh! The Nihilist Anarch coterie is very into this kind of thing with young,
					 Camarilla-affiliated Kindred.
			-Alternately, if unsympathetic, this story is going to be about learning to regret that,
			 and the danger that even the downtrodden can pose if united/empowered.
		-Presentation to the Prince:
			-Featuring scorn demonstrated for the caitiff, somewhere in the social occasion.
			-
		-Deal with Masquerade violation:
			-Tasked by the Prince at presentation.
				-Partial recompense for granting sires permission to embrace the players?
			-
		-Witness Caitiff abuse, by Son?
			-
		-
	-Set in Chicago:
		-Chicago By Night has the city the site of a lot of Camarilla vs. Anarch conflicts, though
		 I can easily set it in any minima or maxima in that conflict.
		 -Yeah, lets set it some time on, with Anarchs in an even worse spot.
		-Let coterie see "Son" preying on Caitiff, then protected by O'Leary and Lodin?
			-Yes! Given his openness to the Sabbat, our Evangelist could even be seen later to reign
			 him in a bit in a way that Camarilla elders were unable to, building some respect for 
			 the Evangelist in the players. . . before his secret is revealed.
		-Fate of the printed Sabbat coterie:
			-Their uprising was thwarted, with Wendy Wade destroyed in the process and Phillipe
			 captured.
				-Chicago Kindred would describe Wade, if at all, as the typically senselessly
				 violent Masquerade risk that they'd stereotype all Sabbat as.
				-Phillipe is staked, his capture known only to Lodin and a trusted lieutenant or
				 two.
					-He was already the same generation as Lodin, so maybe up that by one to explain
					 why Dominate hasn't gotten anything from him yet, and why he's kept around
					 until perhaps it could.
						-After all, a Sabbat of such high generation?!?
						-Perhaps Phillipe even got that extra bump from diablerie in Chicago?
				-Tyler's past was never revealed, but Phillipe did reach out to her, and she now
				 lives in fear it _was_ revealed (and would be very alarmed to learn Phillipe wasn't
				 destroyed).
				-Son's contact with them also went unknown to the rest of Chicago.
					-He's perhaps concerned that his involvement could hurt them, but not at all
					 turned off by their revealed affiliation.
	-Set one or more of coterie up for the bond?
		-Ignorantly falling into it is a common them in Chicago by Night.
